    This stunning bird is a peacock. Do you know why he is spreading out his big, colorful tail feathers like a fan? He is trying to attract a female for mating. Both the feathers and the behavior evolved because they increase the chances that males of the species will reproduce and pass their genes to the next generation. Many other vertebrates have similar behaviors for attracting mates. Even fish display some remarkably sophisticated mating behaviors.

    Fish and birds are both vertebrates. Vertebrates are a diverse and fascinating group of animals. In many ways, they are very different from the invertebrates described in previous chapters. Elaborate mating behaviors are just one way they differ. This chapter describes many other differences between vertebrates and invertebrates. It also describes in detail the classes of vertebrates from fish to birds.

   Characteristics of Vertebrates
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-OTBjNjhhMjM3ZmYzMDg4ZjkzNTRlM2Y5MjY1MjUxODc.-ljm">
   The main distinguishing feature of vertebrates is their vertebral column, or backbone (see
   <strong>

   ). The backbone runs from the head to the tail along the dorsal (top) side of the body. The vertebral column is the core of the endoskeleton. It allows a vertebrate to hold its shape. It also houses and protects the spinal (nerve) cord that passes through it. The vertebral column is made up of repeating units called
   <strong>
    vertebrae
   </strong>
   (singular, vertebra). In many species, there are shock-absorbing discs between the vertebrae to cushion them during movement.

   Vertebrate Endoskeleton
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MDI1MjRmMzc5MTZlMzdlZGQ4NDhjZWE4ZDI4NWUwN2Y.-crv">
   Another distinguishing feature of vertebrates is an endoskeleton made of bone or cartilage.
   <strong>
    Cartilage
   </strong>
   is a tough tissue that contains a protein called collagen.
   <strong>
    Bone
   </strong>
   is a hard tissue that consists of a collagen matrix, or framework, filled in with minerals such as calcium. Bone is less flexible than cartilage but stronger. An endoskeleton made of bone rather than cartilage allows animals to grow larger and heavier. Bone also provides more protection for soft tissues and internal organs. As shown in

   , the vertebrate endoskeleton includes a
   <strong>
    cranium,
   </strong>
   or skull, to enclose and protect the brain. It also generally includes two pairs of limbs. Limb girdles (such as the human hips and shoulders) connect the limbs to the rest of the endoskeleton.

   Other Vertebrate Traits
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZjQ4Nzc1NzY2MTRmNzc5ZDE0NGY2MzhjMWY5ZTRhZGU.-rw1">
   There are several additional traits found in virtually all vertebrates.
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-YTQ4NTM1MDBiMjkwZDRkZjg5MmMzMDc5ODIyODNhMTY.-yig">
   <li>
    Vertebrates have a system of muscles attached to the endoskeleton to enable movement. Muscles control movement by alternately contracting (shortening) and relaxing (lengthening). Generally, muscles work together in opposing pairs.
   </li>
   <li>
    Vertebrates have a closed circulatory system with a heart. Blood is completely contained within blood vessels that carry the blood throughout the body. The heart is divided into chambers that work together to pump blood. There are between two and four chambers in the vertebrate heart. With more chambers, there is more oxygen in the blood and more vigorous pumping action.
   </li>
   <li>
    Most vertebrates have skin covered with scales, feathers, fur, or hair. These features serve a variety of functions, such as waterproofing and insulating the body.
   </li>
   <li>
    Vertebrates have an excretory system that includes a pair of kidneys.
    <strong>
     Kidneys
    </strong>
    are organs that filter wastes from blood so they can be excreted from the body.
   </li>
   <li>
    Vertebrates have an endocrine system of glands that secrete hormones. Hormones are chemical messengers that control many body functions.
   </li>
   <li>
    Vertebrates have an adaptive immune system. The
    <strong>
     immune system
    </strong>
    is the organ system that defends the body from pathogens and other causes of disease. Being adaptive means that the immune system can
    <em>
     learn
    </em>
    to recognize specific pathogens. Then it can produce tailor-made chemicals called antibodies to
    <em>
     attack
    </em>
    them. This allows the immune system to launch a rapid attack whenever the pathogens invade the body again.
   </li>
   <li>
    Vertebrates have a centralized nervous system. As shown in
    <strong>
     Figure
    </strong>
    <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTAzLWh1bWFuLW5lcnZvdXMtc3lzdGVt">
     below
    </a>
    , the nervous system consists of a brain in the head region. It also includes a long spinal cord that runs from the brain to the tail end of the backbone. Long nerve fibers extend from the spinal cord to muscles and organs throughout the body.

   Vertebrate Reproduction
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZTJjMWVlMjc1ZjNmNWM5YzhhZTRlYjA2YTE5YTdmZjM.-2b5">
   Vertebrates reproduce sexually, and almost all of them have separate male and female sexes. Generally, aquatic species have external fertilization, whereas terrestrial species have internal fertilization. Can you think of a reason why aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates differ in this way? Vertebrates have one of the following three reproductive strategies: ovipary, ovovivipary, or vivipary.
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-MzM0YjBhMmQ1MTE5MDZkYmI3Mjg0ZWJiZGI3ZTRhNzQ.-odv">
   <li>
    <strong>
     Ovipary
    </strong>
    refers to the development of an embryo within an egg outside the mother&#8217;s body. This occurs in most amphibians and reptiles and in all birds.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Ovovivipary
    </strong>
    refers to the development of an embryo inside an egg within the mother&#8217;s body until it hatches. The mother provides no nourishment to the developing embryo inside the egg. This occurs in some species of fish and reptiles.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Vivipary
    </strong>
    refers to the development and nourishment of an embryo within the mother&#8217;s body. Birth may be followed by a period of parental care of the offspring. This reproductive strategy occurs in almost all mammals.

   Not too long after hagfish first appeared, fish similar to lampreys evolved a partial vertebral column. The first fish with a complete vertebral column evolved about 450 million years ago. These fish also had jaws and may have been similar to living sharks. Up to this point, all early vertebrates had an endoskeleton made of cartilage rather than bone. About 400 million years ago, the first bony fish appeared. A bony skeletal could support a larger body. Early bony fish evolved into modern ray-finned and lobe-finned fish.

   Evolution of Endothermy
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZWY0NTExM2U4NDFjZTdmMWUzYWUwYTA5MGY5YWVjNDU.-uzb">
   Until mammals and birds evolved, all vertebrates were ectothermic.
   <strong>
    Ectothermy
   </strong>
   means regulating body temperature from the outside through behavioral changes. For example, an ectotherm might stay under a rock in the shade in order to keep cool on a hot, sunny day. Almost all living fish, amphibians, and reptiles are ectothermic. Their metabolic rate and level of activity depend mainly on the outside temperature. They can raise or lower their own temperature only slightly through behavior alone.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-OTQ3YTEyMmEzMTM2ZWM4OWYwOGRjMDRkNGFmOTUxZTI.-fy6">
   Both mammals and birds evolved endothermy.
   <strong>
    Endothermy
   </strong>
   means regulating body temperature from the inside through metabolic or other physical changes. On a cold day, for example, an endotherm may produce more heat by raising its metabolic rate. On a hot day, it may give off more heat by increasing blood flow to the surface of the body. Keeping body temperature stable allows cells to function at peak efficiency at all times. The metabolic rate and activity level can also remain high regardless of the outside temperature. On the other hand, maintaining a stable body temperature requires more energy&#8212;and more food.

    The earliest vertebrates resembled hagfish and lived more than 500 million years ago. As other classes of fish appeared, they evolved traits such as a complete vertebral column, jaws, and a bony endoskeleton. Amphibians were the first tetrapod vertebrates as well as the first vertebrates to live on land. Reptiles were the first amniotic vertebrates. Mammals and birds, which both descended from reptile-like ancestors, evolved endothermy, or the ability to regulate body temperature from the inside.

   Structure and Function in Fish
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-MzdkZTk0ZjNmZGJmYTc5YzdmYTBmOTc4ZTU5YjMyNTU.-zjq">
   Fish show great diversity in body size. They range in length from about 8 millimeters (0.3 inches) to 16 meters (about 53 feet). Most are ectothermic and covered with scales. Scales protect fish from predators and parasites and reduce friction with the water. Multiple, overlapping scales provide a flexible covering that allows fish to move easily while swimming.

   Many structures in fish are adaptations for their aquatic lifestyle. Several are described below and shown in

   <li>
    Fish have gills that allow them to &#8220;breathe&#8221; oxygen in water. Water enters the mouth, passes over the gills, and exits the body through a special opening. Gills absorb oxygen from the water as it passes over them.
   </li>
   <li>
    Fish have a stream-lined body. They are typically long and narrow, which reduces water resistance when they swim.
   </li>
   <li>
    Most fish have several fins for swimming. They use some of their fins to propel themselves through the water and others to steer the body as they swim.
   </li>
   <li>
    Fish have a system of muscles for movement. Muscle contractions ripple through the body in waves from head to tail. The contractions whip the tail fin against the water to propel the fish through the water.
   </li>
   <li>
    Most fish have a
    <strong>
     swim bladder.
    </strong>
    This is a balloon-like internal organ that contains gas. By changing the amount of gas in the bladder, a fish can move up or down through the water column.

   Fish Organ Systems
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZjkxNzBkNTcyMjc3ZGZlMDVjNzA1NmQ4ZjZkOWI1M2Y.-4dn">
   Fish have a circulatory system with a two-chambered heart. Their digestive system is complete and includes several organs and glands. Jawed fish use their jaws and teeth to grind up food before passing it to the rest of the digestive tract. This allows them to consume larger prey.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-YzE1ZTQ1NmMwMzcxN2FmNDg4ZDBhNTdiMmQyMTZjYzE.-loh">
   Fish also have a centralized nervous system with a brain. Fish brains are small compared with the brains of other vertebrates, but they are large and complex compared with the brains of invertebrates. Fish also have highly developed sense organs that allow them to see, hear, feel, smell, and taste. Sharks and some other fish can even sense the very low levels of electricity emitted by other animals. This helps them locate prey.

   Fish Reproduction and Development
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-YzcwMmRmNDU4MDkzOWUyOGM0YTgwMjE1OTFhNmJkMDc.-koz">
   Nearly all fish reproduce sexually, and most species have separate sexes. Those without separate sexes avoid self-fertilization by producing sperm and eggs at different times. Each fish typically produces a large number of gametes. In most fish species, fertilization takes place externally. These fish are oviparous. Eggs are laid and embryos develop outside the mother&#8217;s body. In a minority of fish, including sharks, eggs develop inside the mother&#8217;s body but without nourishment from the mother. These fish are ovoviviparous.

  <h3 id="x-ck12-U3Bhd25pbmc._1-kvq">
   Spawning
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MWFlMGM2OWJhYTA0YTQ3YmNlYzEyOTAyNjA5YWM3ZDg.-ruy">
   In many species of fish, a large group of adults come together to release their gametes into the water at the same time. This is called
   <strong>
    spawning.
   </strong>
   It increases the chances that fertilization will take place. It also means that many embryos will form at once, which helps ensure that at least some of them will be able to escape predators. With spawning, there is no way for fish parents to know which embryos are their own. Therefore, fish generally don&#8217;t provide any care to their eggs or offspring. There are some exceptions, however, including the fish described in

  <p id="x-ck12-MzUxMThhMTA3NzM0M2E1ZWI2ODQxYTA0MDdjYmM1Yzg.-izb">
   Hagfish are very primitive fish. They retain their notochord throughout life rather than developing a backbone, and they lack scales and fins. They are classified as vertebrates mainly because they have a cranium. Hagfish are noted for secreting large amounts of thick, slimy mucus. The mucus makes them slippery, so they can slip out of the jaws of predators.

They can solve problems and interact with other members of their species. They are generally predators with keen senses. Cartilaginous fish lack a swim bladder. Instead, they stay afloat by using a pair of muscular fins to push down against the water and create lift.

   Evolution of Fish
  </h2>

   Invertebrate chordates use their gills to filter food out of water, not to absorb oxygen. In the early evolution of fish, there was a switch to using gills to absorb oxygen instead of to filter food. Gills consist of many thin, folded tissues that provide a large surface area for oxygen uptake. With more oxygen absorbed by the gills, fish could become much larger and more active.

Fossils of cartilaginous fish with jaws, resembling living sharks, first appeared in the fossil record about 450 million years ago. They were followed about 50 million years later by the bony fish.

   The Bony Fish
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-YjI3NmM2YzIwNzUzODA0NjVkNWI4OGE0YmJmMDkyZDg.-adv">
   At first, the lobe-finned bony fish were much more common than the ray-finned bony fish that dominate today. Lobe-finned fish were also ancestral to amphibians. Their stump-like appendages and lung-like organs evolved into amphibian legs and lungs. Ray-finned bony fish may have been the first fish to evolve in freshwater. They eventually became the most diverse and dominant class of fish.

   Fish Food
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-OGU3ZjFhMjYyYTY4ZDNhNDljNjRlODVlOWI3NGZlNmM.-aoy">
   Most fish are predators, but the nature of their prey and how they consume it differs from one class to another and even within classes.
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-NGIxMmM4NmM4NTAwYTAxZmI4ZWZlZTNjMGRkMzFhYjY.-cj5">
   <li>
    Hagfish are deep-ocean bottom dwellers. They feed on other fish, either living or dead. They enter the body of their prey through the mouth or anus. Then they literally eat their prey from the inside out.
   </li>
   <li>
    Lampreys generally live in shallow ocean water or freshwater. They either consume small invertebrates or suck blood from larger fish with their sucker mouth.
   </li>
   <li>
    Cartilaginous fish such as sharks may live on the bottom of the ocean. However, most live in the water column. They prey on other fish and aquatic mammals or else consume plankton.
   </li>
   <li>
    Bony fish may live in salt water or freshwater. They consume a wide range of foods. For example, they may eat algae, smaller fish, detritus, or dead organisms, depending on the species of fish.

   Lesson Summary
  </h2>
  <ul id="x-ck12-MDc1NmM2NzU1MzlhNDA4NDU0OTBmNDkyMjQ1NjcwZjI.-cxh">
   <li>
    Fish are aquatic, ectothermic vertebrates. Many structures in fish are adaptations for their aquatic lifestyle. For example, fish have a stream-lined body that reduces water resistance while swimming. They also have gills for &#8220;breathing&#8221; oxygen in water and fins for propelling and steering their body through water.
   </li>
   <li>
    Nearly all fish reproduce sexually and have separate sexes. Fertilization is generally external, and most fish are oviparous. Many adults of the same species may come together in a group and release gametes into the water at the same time, which is called spawning. Fish hatch into larvae that are different from the adult form of the species.
   </li>
   <li>
    There are about 28,000 existing species of fish, and they are placed in five classes: hagfish, lampreys, cartilaginous fish, ray-finned bony fish, and lobe-finned bony fish.
   </li>
   <li>
    The evolution of fish included a shift from using the gills for filtering food to using them to absorb oxygen from water. The earliest fish, resembling living hagfish, evolved about 550 million years ago. Adaptations that eventually evolved in fish include a complete vertebral column, jaws, and an endoskeleton made of bones instead of cartilage.
   </li>
   <li>
    Fish live throughout the ocean and in freshwater lakes and streams. Most fish are predators, but the nature of their prey and how they consume it may vary. Many species of fish are threatened by human actions, such as water pollution and over-fishing.

   Structure and Function in Amphibians
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-MDQ4YjhjMjQ3MzViNDhmZGFjMDdlNDMxMmQ2ZjAwNTE.-iht">
   Amphibians have less variation in size than fish, ranging in length from 1 centimeter (2.5 inches) to 1.5 meters (about 5 feet). They generally have moist skin without scales. Their skin contains
   <strong>
    keratin,
   </strong>
   a tough, fibrous protein found in the skin, scales, feathers, hair, and nails of tetrapod vertebrates, from amphibians to humans. Some forms of keratin are tougher than others. The form in amphibian skin is not very tough, and it allows gases and water to pass through their skin.

   Amphibian Ectothermy
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZGMyNDEzNzFlMjYzMDRhNTc1NjUwYTE3NGRmNDNmNDM.-rua">
   Amphibians are ectothermic, so their internal body temperature is generally about the same as the temperature of their environment. When it&#8217;s cold outside, their body temperature drops, and they become very sluggish. When the outside temperature rises, so does their body temperature, and they are much more active. What do you think might be some of the pros and cons of ectothermy in amphibians?

   Amphibian Organ Systems
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-OWMxNmMxNTJiZjgwNWNmNzU5ZGMxMWFlZmI0NmJlYmU.-fvd">
   All amphibians have digestive, excretory, and reproductive systems. All three systems share a body cavity called the
   <strong>
    cloaca.
   </strong>
   Wastes enter the cloaca from the digestive and excretory systems, and gametes enter the cloaca from the reproductive system. An opening in the cloaca allows the wastes and gametes to leave the body.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-NDA3ZGIyMjMyYzAzOTgxMDRjOWI4ZTQ4MzRmMjRiM2U.-fnu">
   Amphibians have a relatively complex circulatory system with a three-chambered heart. Their nervous system is also rather complex, allowing them to interact with each other and their environment. Amphibians have sense organs to smell and taste chemicals. Other sense organs include eyes and ears. Of all amphibians, frogs generally have the best vision and hearing. Frogs also have a larynx, or voice box, to make sounds.

  <p id="x-ck12-NTc3M2NlZjg0OGUyMjgyNjBkMmJlNTc3NDBjMGJlMTU.-eyz">
   Most amphibians breathe with gills as larvae and with lungs as adults. Additional oxygen is absorbed through the skin in most species. The skin is kept moist by mucus, which is secreted by mucous glands. In some species, mucous glands also produce toxins, which help protect the amphibians from predators. The golden frog shown in

   Evolution of Amphibians
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZTA3YWFjMWQxN2NiN2ZhNDM2ODY4YTFhMDA4ZjRjYjg.-bwi">
   Fossil evidence shows that amphibians evolved about 365 million years ago from a lobe-finned lungfish ancestor. As the earliest land vertebrates, they were highly successful. Some of them were much larger than today&#8217;s amphibians. For more than 100 million years, amphibians remained the dominant land vertebrates. Then some of them evolved into reptiles. Once reptiles appeared, with their amniotic eggs, they replaced amphibians as the dominant land vertebrates.

   Lesson Summary
  </h2>
  <ul id="x-ck12-NWZkYjBhY2VmNWQ0NTBhYmE5YjAwZGI1OGM2MGM4Yzc.-gxc">
   <li>
    Amphibians are ectothermic vertebrates that divide their time between freshwater and terrestrial habitats. They are the first true tetrapods, or vertebrates with four limbs. Amphibians breathe with gills as larvae and with lungs as adults. They have a three-chambered heart and relatively complex nervous system.
   </li>
   <li>
    Amphibians reproduce sexually with either external or internal fertilization. They may attract mates with calls or scents. They do not produce amniotic eggs, so they must reproduce in water. Their larvae go through metamorphosis to change into the adult form.
   </li>
   <li>
    There are about 6,200 known species of living amphibians that are placed in three orders: frogs and toads, salamanders and newts, and caecilians. Frogs and toads are adapted for jumping. Salamanders and newts may walk or swim. Caecilians live in the water or soil and are the only amphibians without legs.
   </li>
   <li>
    Amphibians evolved about 365 million years ago from a lobe-finned fish ancestor. As the earliest land vertebrates, amphibians were highly successful for more than 100 million years until reptiles took over as the dominant land vertebrates.
   </li>
   <li>
    Amphibians are found throughout the world except in Antarctica and Greenland. They are important prey for animals such as birds, snakes, and raccoons. They are important predators of insects, worms, and other invertebrates. Up to one third of all amphibian species are at risk of extinction because of human actions, such as habitat destruction, climate change, and pollution.

   The scales of reptiles prevent them from absorbing oxygen through their skin, as amphibians can. Instead, reptiles breathe air only through their lungs. However, their lungs are more efficient than the lungs of amphibians, with more surface area for gas exchange. This is another important reptile adaptation for life on land.

  <p id="x-ck12-Mzg1MGM1OTMyZWNkZDBlYzdjMjQ5YzAyNmNmZjcyZWM.-7hz">
   Reptiles have various ways of moving air into and out of their lungs. Lizards and snakes use muscles of the chest wall for this purpose. These are the same muscles used for running, so lizards have to hold their breath when they run. Crocodiles and alligators have a large sheet of muscle below the lungs, called a

   Unlike amphibians, reptiles do not have a larval stage. Instead, newly hatched reptiles look like smaller versions of the adults. They are able to move about on their own, but they are vulnerable to predators. Even so, most reptile parents provide no care to their hatchlings. In fact, most reptiles don&#8217;t even take care of their eggs. For example, female sea turtles lay their eggs on a sandy beach and then return to the ocean. The only exceptions are female crocodiles and alligators. They may defend their nest from predators and help the hatchings reach the water. If the young remain in the area, the mother may continue to protect them for up to a year.

   Ecology of Reptiles
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZTEwN2RkZGZiMGYyN2Q2MGQ2ZWM3NGUyNTFkNjEwYjk.-8nj">
   Today, reptiles live in a wide range of habitats. They can be found on every continent except Antarctica. Many turtles live in the ocean, while others live in freshwater or on land. Lizards are all terrestrial, but their habitats may range from deserts to rainforests, and from underground burrows to the tops of trees. Most snakes are terrestrial and live in a wide range of habitats, but some snakes are aquatic. Crocodilians live in and around swamps or bodies of freshwater or salt water.

   Reptile Diets
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-Y2E3ZmYwNzUwYmJmMzM5Njc0Y2ZjNDM0NmYwZjJiYzk.-lzy">
   What reptiles eat is also very diverse, but the majority of reptiles are carnivores. Large reptiles such as crocodilians are the top predators in their ecosystems, preying on birds, fish, deer, turtles, and sometimes domestic livestock. Their powerful jaws can crush bones and even turtle shells. Smaller reptiles&#8212;including tuataras, snakes, and many lizards&#8212;are also important predators, preying on insects, frogs, birds, and small mammals such as mice.
  </p>

   Many species of reptiles, especially marine reptiles, are at risk of extinction. Some are threatened by habitat loss. For example, many beaches where turtles lay their eggs have been taken over and developed by people. Other marine reptiles have been over-hunted by humans. Marine turtles and their eggs are still eaten in some countries despite being protected species.

  <p id="x-ck12-OTkwNTA5ODgyMmEwYzM0MThjYjRhY2ViNmNiMDhiOGE.-t2h">
   Some reptiles are preyed upon by non-native species introduced by humans. For example, marine iguanas on the Gal&#225;pagos Islands are threatened by dogs and cats that people have brought to the islands. The iguanas are slow and tame and have no adaptations to these new predators.

   Lesson Summary

  <ul id="x-ck12-MTE3MjEyNDZiNWNjYzAxNTZhMmIwZTM0OTYzYzJmN2U.-f0l">
   <li>
    Reptiles are a class of ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates. They have several adaptations for living on dry land, such as tough keratin scales and efficient lungs for breathing air. They also have a three-chambered heart and relatively well-developed brain.
   </li>
   <li>
    Most reptiles reproduce sexually and have internal fertilization. Their eggs are amniotic, so they can be laid on land instead of in water. Reptiles do not have a larval stage, and their hatchlings are relatively mature. Reptile parents provide little if any care to their young.
   </li>
   <li>
    There are more than 8,200 living species of reptiles, and they are placed in four orders: Crocodilia, which includes crocodiles and alligators; Sphenodontia, or tuataras; Squamata, which includes lizards and snakes; and Testudines, such as turtles and tortoises.
   </li>
   <li>
    The earliest amniotes appeared about 350 million years ago, and the earliest reptiles evolved from a sauropsid ancestor by about 315 million years ago. Dinosaurs evolved around 225 million years ago and dominated animal life on land until 65 million years ago, when they all went extinct. Other reptiles survived and evolved into the classes of reptiles that exist today.

    Birds have air sacs that store inhaled air and push it into the lungs like bellows. This keeps the lungs constantly filled with oxygenated air. The lungs also contain millions of tiny passages that create a very large surface area for gas exchange with the blood (see

    Birds have a relatively large, four-chambered heart. The heart beats rapidly to keep oxygenated blood flowing to muscles and other tissues. Hummingbirds have the fastest heart rate at up to 1,200 times per minute. That&#8217;s almost 20 times faster than the human resting heart rate!

    Birds have a sac-like structure called a

    to store and moisten food that is waiting to be digested. They also have an organ called a
    <strong>
     gizzard

   Nervous System and Sense Organs

  <p id="x-ck12-YmEwOTA5YzE2NTA1YWIyZDEyMGIyOTIwNTA0YTZmMGQ.-mxa">
   Birds have a large brain relative to the size of their body. Not surprisingly, the part of the brain that controls flight is the most developed part. The large brain size of birds is also reflected by their high level of intelligence and complex behavior. In fact, birds such as crows and ravens may be more intelligent than many mammals. They are smart enough to use objects such as twigs for tools. They also demonstrate planning and cooperation. Most birds have a poor sense of smell, but they make up for it with their excellent sense of sight. Predatory birds have especially good eyesight. Hawks, for example, have vision that is eight times sharper than human vision.

   Bird Reproduction
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-NmNhNWE1YWM2ZDg4NDNhYzAzZWJiYjMwMzliZWY0NWU.-gox">
   Reproduction in birds may be quite complicated and lengthy. Birds reproduce sexually and have separate sexes and internal fertilization, so males and females must mate for fertilization to occur. Mating is generally preceded by courtship. In most species, parents also take care of their eggs and hatchlings.

   <strong>
    Courtship
   </strong>
   is behavior that is intended to attract a mate. It may involve singing specific courtship songs or putting on some type of visual display. For example, a bird may spread out and display its tail feathers or do a ritualized mating &#8220;dance.&#8221; Typically, males perform the courtship behavior, and females choose a mate from among competing males.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-Y2IzNzEyNDBhZDE5NDNmM2Y5ODY2OGMwMzViNTY1YmU.-vsc">
   During mating, a male bird presses his cloaca against his mate&#8217;s cloaca and passes sperm from his cloaca to hers. After fertilization, eggs pass out of the female&#8217;s body, exiting through the opening in the cloaca.

   Ground-nesting birds, such as ducks and chickens, have hatchlings that are able to run around and feed themselves almost as soon as they break through the eggshell. Being on the ground makes them vulnerable to predators, so they need to be relatively mature when they hatch in order to escape. In contrast, birds that nest off the ground&#8212;in trees, bushes, or buildings&#8212;have hatchlings that are naked and helpless. The parents must protect and feed the immature offspring for weeks or even months. However, this gives the offspring more time to learn from the parents before they leave the nest and go out on their own.

   KQED: The Turkey Vulture
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MjM2MDljY2NlYTkzZWU1NzU4ZTcwMzdlNWU1ZmIyN2I.-38p">
   Ever wonder why a vulture's head is bald? Turkey Vultures are very interesting birds. The Turkey Vulture has no vocal organs &#8211; they can only grunt or hiss, although they usually stay silent. They do not build nests &#8211; they lay their eggs directly on the ground in caves, crevices, burrows, hollow logs, under fallen trees, or even in abandoned buildings. While these vultures have few natural predators, their main form of defense is vomiting. The foul smelling substance deters most creatures, and will also sting if the offending animal is close enough to get vomit on them. Learn more about Turkey Vultures at

   Lesson Summary
  </h2>
  <ul id="x-ck12-ZDRmYTEzYjJmYmRlMzJkZmYwYTZhNTY0NTA1Zjk2MDk.-k6g">
   <li>
    Birds are endothermic tetrapod vertebrates. They are bipedal and have wings and feathers. Their organ systems are adapted for flight. For example, they have light-weight air-filled bones and a large four-chambered heart. Birds also have relatively large brains and a high level of intelligence.
   </li>
   <li>
    Birds reproduce sexually and have internal fertilization. Mating is generally preceded by courtship. Their amniotic eggs have hard shells and are laid in a nest. The eggs are usually incubated until they hatch. Most species have a relatively long period of parental care.
   </li>
   <li>
    There are about 10,000 living species of birds, almost all of which can fly. Flying birds are divided into 29 orders. The most common orders include landfowl, waterfowl, shorebirds, diurnal and nocturnal raptors, parrots, and perching birds.
   </li>
   <li>
    Birds are thought to have evolved from theropod dinosaurs around 150 million years ago. Their ancestor may have been similar to the extinct theropod
    <em>
     Deinonychus,
    </em>
    whose fossils convinced most scientists that birds evolved from dinosaurs. Scientist still don&#8217;t know how or why wings and flight evolved, but they continue to search for answers.
   </li>
   <li>
    Birds live and breed in most terrestrial habitats on all seven continents. They occupy a wide range of ecological positions. Raptors are carnivores; aquatic birds eat fish or water plants; and perching birds may eat insects, fruit, honey, or nectar. Some birds are pollinators that co-evolved with plants. Human actions have caused the extinction of hundreds of species of birds, and some 1,200 species are threatened with extinction today.
   </li>
