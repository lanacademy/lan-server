    The Grand Canyon, shown here, is an American icon and one of the wonders of the natural world. It&#8217;s also a record of the past. Look at the rock layers in the picture. If you were to walk down a trail to the bottom of the canyon, with each step down you would be taking a step back in time. That&#8217;s because lower layers of rock represent the more distant past. The rock layers and the fossils they contain show the history of Earth and its organisms over a 2-billion-year time span. Although Charles Darwin never visited the Grand Canyon, he saw rock layers and fossils in other parts of the world. They were one inspiration for his theory of evolution. Darwin&#8217;s theory rocked the scientific world. In this chapter, you will read why.

   The Englishman Charles Darwin is one of the most famous scientists who ever lived. His place in the history of science is well deserved. Darwin&#8217;s theory of evolution represents a giant leap in human understanding. It explains and unifies all of biology.

   Darwin&#8217;s Theory at a Glance
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-OTJkNDBjMGZmYjk1ZTEyYWQ3Yzc5NWQ5MWQzMTFjMjM.-lhm">
   Darwin&#8217;s theory of evolution actually contains two major ideas:
  </p>
  <ol id="x-ck12-ZTUwZTMyNzQyN2JiMGU4NWI1MDg3MTEzZmM1MDhkYjE.-on9" class="x-ck12-decimal">
   <li>
    One idea is that evolution occurs. In other words, organisms change over time. Life on Earth has changed as descendants diverged from common ancestors in the past.
   </li>
   <li>
    The other idea is that evolution occurs by natural selection. Natural selection is the process in which living things with beneficial traits produce more offspring than others do. This results in changes in the traits of living things over time.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZTFlZTQ3ZDc5NDZiMGJlYjExM2RmM2ZhZTViYTc2YjU.-kxn">
   In Darwin&#8217;s day, most people believed that all species were created at the same time and remained unchanged thereafter. They also believed that Earth was only 6,000 years old. Therefore, Darwin&#8217;s ideas revolutionized biology. How did Darwin come up with these important ideas? It all started when he went on a voyage.

   In 1831, when Darwin was just 22 years old, he set sail on a scientific expedition on a ship called the
   <em>
    HMS Beagle

   Darwin was fascinated by nature, so he loved his job on the
   <em>
    Beagle.
   </em>
   He spent more than 3 years of the 5-year trip exploring nature on distant continents and islands. While he was away, a former teacher published Darwin&#8217;s accounts of his observations. By the time Darwin finally returned to England, he had become famous as a naturalist.

   Darwin&#8217;s Observations
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZDU1YWM3YWE4YzY2MjkyMGYyMDBmOGE1ZGJmZWMzZmU.-fvt">
   During the long voyage, Darwin made many observations that helped him form his theory of evolution. For example:
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-M2FjODk1Zjg3ODE5NGYzNmM2M2NhNDZjMzUyMjc5MDc.-gb1">
   <li>
    He visited tropical rainforests and other new habitats where he saw many plants and animals he had never seen before (see
    <strong>
     Figure
    </strong>
    <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTEwLTAyLUdhbGFwYWdvcy1zcGVjaWVz">
     below
    </a>
    ). This impressed him with the great diversity of life.
   </li>
   <li>
    He experienced an earthquake that lifted the ocean floor 2.7 meters (9 feet) above sea level. He also found rocks containing fossil sea shells in mountains high above sea level. These observations suggested that continents and oceans had changed dramatically over time and continue to change in dramatic ways.
   </li>
   <li>
    He visited rock ledges that had clearly once been beaches that had gradually built up over time. This suggested that slow, steady processes also change Earth&#8217;s surface.
   </li>
   <li>
    He dug up fossils of gigantic extinct mammals, such as the ground sloth (see
    <strong>
     Figure
    </strong>
    <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTEwLTAyLUdhbGFwYWdvcy1zcGVjaWVz">

    </a>
    ). This was hard evidence that organisms looked very different in the past. It suggested that living things&#8212;like Earth&#8217;s surface&#8212;change over time.

   Individual Gal&#225;pagos islands differ from one another in important ways. Some are rocky and dry. Others have better soil and more rainfall. Darwin noticed that the plants and animals on the different islands also differed. For example, the giant tortoises on one island had saddle-shaped shells, while those on another island had dome-shaped shells (see
   <strong>
    Figure
   </strong>
   <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTEwLTA0LXR1cnRsZXM.">

   ). People who lived on the islands could even tell the island a turtle came from by its shell. This started Darwin thinking about the origin of species. He wondered how each island came to have its own type of tortoise.

   Earlier Thinkers Who Influenced Darwin
  </h3>
  <ol id="x-ck12-YzRjNWZhMWE1ZGZhMzMwYmZmNWMwOGVlNWJiMzljMzQ.-8t3" class="x-ck12-decimal">
   <li>
    Jean Baptiste Lamarck (1744&#8211;1829) was an important French naturalist. He was one of the first scientists to propose that species change over time. However, Lamarck was wrong about how species change. His idea of the
    <strong>
     inheritance of acquired characteristics
    </strong>
    is incorrect. Traits an organism develops during its own life time cannot be passed on to offspring, as Lamarck believed.
   </li>
   <li>
    Charles Lyell (1797&#8211;1875) was a well-known English geologist. Darwin took his book,
    <em>
     Principles of Geology,
    </em>
    with him on the
    <em>
     Beagle
    </em>
    . In the book, Lyell argued that gradual geological processes have gradually shaped Earth&#8217;s surface. From this, Lyell inferred that Earth must be far older than most people believed.
   </li>
   <li>
    Thomas Malthus (1766&#8211;1834) was an English economist. He wrote an essay titled
    <em>
     On Population
    </em>
    . In the essay, Malthus argued that human populations grow faster than the resources they depend on. When populations become too large, famine and disease break out. In the end, this keeps populations in check by killing off the weakest members.

   These weren&#8217;t the only influences on Darwin. He was also aware that humans could breed plants and animals to have useful traits. By selecting which animals were allowed to reproduce, they could change an organism&#8217;s traits. The pigeons in

   <strong>
    artificial selection

   . He used the word
   <em>
    artificial
   </em>
   to distinguish it from natural selection.

   Did you ever hear the saying that &#8220;great minds think alike?&#8221; It certainly applies to Charles Darwin and another English naturalist named Alfred Russel Wallace. Wallace lived at about the same time as Darwin. He also traveled to distant places to study nature. Wallace wasn&#8217;t as famous as Darwin. However, he developed basically the same theory of evolution. While working in distant lands, Wallace sent Darwin a paper he had written. In the paper, Wallace explained his evolutionary theory. This served to confirm what Darwin already thought.

  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-MWZjNjM0NjRlZjcxZGUxYTc4ODcxZTk3NjZmNmQwZjA.-s0l">
   Darwin spent many years thinking about the work of Lamarck, Lyell, and Malthus, what he had seen on his voyage, and artificial selection. What did all this mean? How did it all fit together? It fits together in Darwin&#8217;s theory of evolution by natural selection. It&#8217;s easy to see how all of these influences helped shape Darwin&#8217;s ideas.

   Evolution of Darwin&#8217;s Theory
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MGM0NjRkNTM0YzYxMTc2ZDk2OWVlZGQ0MWE5N2RjZTQ.-9kb">
   It took Darwin years to form his theory of evolution by natural selection. His reasoning went like this:
  </p>
  <ol id="x-ck12-MzQ3MGNiZmY2YjJjZTJlNDI0ZDMxMzA1NDkwYjVhMjU.-glb" class="x-ck12-decimal">
   <li>
    Like Lamarck, Darwin assumed that species can change over time. The fossils he found helped convince him of that.
   </li>
   <li>
    From Lyell, Darwin saw that Earth and its life were very old. Thus, there had been enough time for evolution to produce the great diversity of life Darwin had observed.
   </li>
   <li>
    From Malthus, Darwin knew that populations could grow faster than their resources. This &#8220;overproduction of offspring&#8221; led to a &#8220;struggle for existence,&#8221; in Darwin&#8217;s words.
   </li>
   <li>
    From artificial selection, Darwin knew that some offspring have chance variations that can be inherited. In nature, offspring with certain variations might be more likely to survive the &#8220;struggle for existence&#8221; and reproduce. If so, they would pass their favorable variations to their offspring.
   </li>
   <li>
    Darwin coined the term
    <strong>
     fitness
    </strong>
    to refer to an organism&#8217;s relative ability to survive and produce fertile offspring. Nature selects the variations that are most useful. Therefore, he called this type of selection natural selection.
   </li>
   <li>
    Darwin knew artificial selection could change domestic species over time. He inferred that natural selection could also change species over time. In fact, he thought that if a species changed enough, it might evolve into a new species.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p id="x-ck12-ODNlMTY2ZDZlMTA4YWY0ZWY4MGQ5MzI2N2MxMzUyZTY.-akh">
   Wallace&#8217;s paper not only confirmed Darwin&#8217;s ideas. They pushed him to finish his book,
   <em>
    On the Origin of Species.
   </em>
   Published in 1859, this book changed science forever. It clearly spelled out Darwin&#8217;s theory of evolution by natural selection and provided convincing arguments and evidence to support it.

   Applying Darwin&#8217;s Theory
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NzY2MDZkNjkxNGZmZmMwNTczMTFjMzJhN2M1MzU1OGY.-tma">
   The following example applies Darwin&#8217;s theory. It explains how giraffes came to have such long necks (see
   <strong>
    Figure
   </strong>
   <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTEwLTA2LUdpcmFmZmVz">

   ).
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-NmI2MzM5YzYwM2QyZWE5N2FkNjA4Njc0OTAyNTZiZGQ.-sff">
   <li>
    In the past, giraffes had short necks. But there was chance variation in neck length. Some giraffes had necks a little longer than the average.
   </li>
   <li>
    Then, as now, giraffes fed on tree leaves. Perhaps the environment changed, and leaves became scarcer. There would be more giraffes than the trees could support. Thus, there would be a &#8220;struggle for existence.&#8221;
   </li>
   <li>
    Giraffes with longer necks had an advantage. They could reach leaves other giraffes could not. Therefore, the long-necked giraffes were more likely to survive and reproduce. They had greater fitness.
   </li>
   <li>
    These giraffes passed the long-neck trait to their offspring. Each generation, the population contained more long-necked giraffes. Eventually, all giraffes had long necks.

   KQED: Chasing Beetles, Finding Darwin
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NTkxMDE0ZmE5YzY3N2QyMDljMzY0YWJmYmI5NmY2Nzk.-1af">
   It's been over 150 years since Charles Darwin published
   <em>
    On the Origin of Species
   </em>
   . Yet his ideas remain as central to scientific exploration as ever, and has been called the
   <em>
    unifying
   </em>
   concept of all biology. Is evolution continuing today? Of course it is.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-MmYwOWQyZjQxMGU2OWRjMDNhZDY4Y2Y0MmM0Mzc2NTQ.-1sj">
   QUEST follows researchers who are still unlocking the mysteries of evolution, including entomologist David Kavanaugh of the California Academy of Sciences, who predicted that a new beetle species would be found on the Trinity Alps of Northern California. See

  <p id="x-ck12-MmY5ODRhZmU0N2Y2NDYwMWVkZTFhNGY5NGFhZTM1ZDQ.-c4o">
   It's rare for a biologist to predict the discovery of a new species &#8211; even for someone like Kavanaugh, who has discovered many new species. For his prediction, Kavanaugh drew inspiration from Darwin's own 1862 prediction. When Darwin observed an orchid from Madagascar with a foot-long nectare, he predicted that a pollinator would be found with a tongue long enough to reach the nectar inside the orchid's very thin, elongated nectar "pouch," though he had never seen such a bird or insect. Darwin's prediction was based on his finding that all species are related to each other and that some of them evolve together, developing similar adaptations. His prediction came true in 1903, when a moth was discovered in Madagascar with a long, thin proboscis, which it uncurls to reach the nectar in the orchid's nectare. In the process of feeding from the orchid, the moth serves as its pollinator. The moth was given the scientific name
   <em>
    Xanthopan morganii praedicta
   </em>
   , in honor of Darwin&#8217;s prediction.

   The oldest horse fossils show what the earliest horses were like. They were about the size of a fox, and they had four long toes. Other evidence shows they lived in wooded marshlands, where they probably ate soft leaves. Through time, the climate became drier, and grasslands slowly replaced the marshes. Later fossils show that horses changed as well.

    They became taller, which would help them see predators while they fed in tall grasses.

   <li>
    They evolved a single large toe that eventually became a hoof. This would help them run swiftly and escape predators.

   <li>
    Their molars (back teeth) became longer and covered with cement. This would allow them to grind tough grasses and grass seeds without wearing out their teeth.

    Comparative embryology
   </strong>
   is the study of the similarities and differences in the embryos of different species. Similarities in embryos are evidence of common ancestry. All vertebrate embryos, for example, have gill slits and tails. All of the animals in the figure, except for fish, lose their gill slits by adulthood. Some of them also lose their tail. In humans, the tail is reduced to the tail bone. Thus, similarities organisms share as embryos may be gone by adulthood. This is why it is valuable to compare organisms in the embryonic stage. See

Others went to South America. They crossed the Isthmus of Panama. Once camels reached these different places, they evolved independently. They evolved adaptations that suited them for the particular environment where they lived.

   In the 1970s, biologists Peter and Rosemary Grant went to the Gal&#225;pagos Islands. They wanted to re-study Darwin&#8217;s finches. They spent more than 30 years on the project. Their efforts paid off. They were able to observe evolution by natural selection actually taking place. While the Grants were on the Gal&#225;pagos, a drought occurred. As a result, fewer seeds were available for finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could crack open and eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks could crack and eat seeds of all sizes. As a result, many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. Birds with bigger beaks survived and reproduced (see

   Darwin knew that heritable variations are needed for evolution to occur. However, he knew nothing about Mendel&#8217;s laws of genetics. Mendel&#8217;s laws were rediscovered in the early 1900s. Only then could scientists fully understand the process of evolution.

   The Scale of Evolution
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-M2VlYWIwYzExMzgyM2ZiYTExNjg4MGM5ZmI5NTZiYTM.-cds">
   We now know that variations of traits are heritable. These variations are determined by different alleles. We also know that evolution is due to a change in alleles over time. How long a time? That depends on the scale of evolution.

    <strong>
     Microevolution
    </strong>
    occurs over a relatively short period of time within a population or species. The Grants observed this level of evolution in Darwin&#8217;s finches.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Macroevolution
    </strong>
    occurs over geologic time above the level of the species. The fossil record reflects this level of evolution. It results from microevolution taking place over many generations.

   Genes in Populations
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZWVhYjUxN2U4M2I0NzQwNjc4MTIxOTFiNmFiM2QxMTA.-09g">
   Individuals do not evolve. Their genes do not change over time. The unit of evolution is the population. A population consists of organisms of the same species that live in the same area. In terms of evolution, the population is assumed to be a relatively closed group. This means that most mating takes place within the population. The science that focuses on evolution within populations is
   <strong>
    population genetics
   </strong>
   . It is a combination of evolutionary theory and Mendelian genetics.

   Gene Pool
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MGFlOWQzMTU3NTI4ZjZmOWUxZjY5MDBiYTVlNGIwNGU.-uxe">
   The genetic makeup of an individual is the individual&#8217;s genotype. A population consists of many genotypes. Altogether, they make up the population&#8217;s gene pool. The
   <strong>
    gene pool
   </strong>
   consists of all the genes of all the members of the population. For each gene, the gene pool includes all the different alleles for the gene that exist in the population. For a given gene, the population is characterized by the frequency of the different alleles in the gene pool.

   Allele Frequencies

  <p id="x-ck12-MjgwYjVkODBiMzBkY2VmMzAzNTYxNjc0NjI4ZDIyODU.-b98">
   <strong>
    Allele frequency
   </strong>
   is how often an allele occurs in a gene pool relative to the other alleles for that gene. Look at the example in
   <strong>
    Table
   </strong>
   <a href="#x-ck12-dGFibGU6YWxsZWxlcy1nZW5lLXBvb2w.">
    below
   </a>
   . The population in the table has 100 members. In a sexually reproducing species, each member of the population has two copies of each gene. Therefore, the total number of copies of each gene in the gene pool is 200. The gene in the example exists in the gene pool in two forms, alleles
   <em>
    A
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    a
   </em>
   . Knowing the genotypes of each population member, we can count the number of alleles of each type in the gene pool. The table shows how this is done.

   The Hardy-Weinberg Theorem
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-MmI3M2Y3YzU2OTkzODE3ODM3OTk2ODI3NDBjOTZhMjE.-ydd">
   Hardy was an English mathematician. Weinberg was a German doctor. Each worked alone to come up with the founding principle of population genetics. Today, that principle is called the
   <strong>
    Hardy-Weinberg theorem
   </strong>
   . It shows that allele frequencies do not change in a population if certain conditions are met. Such a population is said to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The conditions for equilibrium are:
  </p>
  <ol id="x-ck12-ZGE1NDJkOGUwYzVkNzllZWVkZTg4MjIwMzcwMjYxNDI.-evq" class="x-ck12-decimal">
   <li>
    No new mutations are occurring. Therefore, no new alleles are being created.
   </li>
   <li>
    There is no migration. In other words, no one is moving into or out of the population.
   </li>
   <li>
    The population is very large.
   </li>
   <li>
    Mating is at random in the population. This means that individuals do not choose mates based on genotype.
   </li>
   <li>
    There is no natural selection. Thus, all members of the population have an equal chance of reproducing and passing their genes to the next generation.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p id="x-ck12-Y2VhN2Y5ZGU5YzFjODQxZTZiNGUwOTI4Zjg0OWJmY2M.-hgp">
   When all these conditions are met, allele frequencies stay the same. Genotype frequencies also remain constant. In addition, genotype frequencies can be expressed in terms of allele frequencies, as

   Forces of Evolution
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-N2M0ZDJhMmE3MGI5ZDA4MjAyZjhiZmM4MTIyMThjMmY.-gt8">
   The conditions for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are unlikely to be met in real populations. The Hardy-Weinberg theorem also describes populations in which allele frequencies are not changing. By definition, such populations are not evolving. How does the theorem help us understand evolution in the real world?
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-YWM2YjFjZGMxYTc4ZmJlNjk4ZGU1NTcyYzk5YWFmNjM.-vma">
   From the theorem, we can infer factors that cause allele frequencies to change. These factors are the forces of evolution. There are four such forces: mutation, gene flow, genetic drift, and natural selection.
  </p>
  <h3 id="x-ck12-TXV0YXRpb24._2-qno">
   Mutation
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-OGJjYjE5NmRjOWU2YWI0OGUzODc0MTRlNmY4ZDRlNmM.-ens">
   Mutation creates new genetic variation in a gene pool. It is how all new alleles first arise. In sexually reproducing species, the mutations that matter for evolution are those that occur in gametes. Only these mutations can be passed to offspring. For any given gene, the chance of a mutation occurring in a given gamete is very low. Thus, mutations alone do not have much effect on allele frequencies. However, mutations provide the genetic variation needed for other forces of evolution to act.
  </p>
  <h3 id="x-ck12-R2VuZSBGbG93_2-9ip">
   Gene Flow
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MzdmMGE1YWRlNDIwYTllOTQ4Y2JjMmEyNTc1MzljM2Y.-obh">
   <strong>
    Gene flow
   </strong>
   occurs when individuals move into or out of a population. If the rate of migration is high, this can have a significant effect on allele frequencies. Both the population they leave and the population they enter may change.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-YTcwNzg1NGE4NjgyN2E0MThiMTc0MjY2ZGU0ZjFhZmI.-fa5">
   During the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s, many American servicemen had children with Vietnamese women. Most of the servicemen returned to the United States after the war. However, they left copies of their genes behind in their offspring. In this way, they changed the allele frequencies in the Vietnamese gene pool. Was the gene pool of the American population also affected? Why or why not?
  </p>
  <h3 id="x-ck12-R2VuZXRpYyBEcmlmdA.._2-duv">
   Genetic Drift
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZTBkMzhiN2NlNDE3YjY2NzA2Nzc0MTBlMzJlOGIzZGM.-7yz">
   <strong>
    Genetic drift
   </strong>
   is a random change in allele frequencies that occurs in a small population. When a small number of parents produce just a few offspring, allele frequencies in the offspring may differ, by chance, from allele frequencies in the parents. This is like tossing a coin. If you toss a coin just a few times, you may, by chance, get more or less than the expected 50 percent heads or tails. In a small population, you may also, by chance, get different allele frequencies than expected in the next generation. In this way, allele frequencies may drift over time. There are two special conditions under which genetic drift occurs. They are called bottleneck effect and founder effect.
  </p>
  <ol id="x-ck12-ZmY1NzNlZGZjZTZhYjc4YTAxOTg4NzY2MTMyZTFjYzk.-dim" class="x-ck12-decimal">
   <li>
    Bottleneck effect occurs when a population suddenly gets much smaller. This might happen because of a natural disaster such as a forest fire. By chance, allele frequencies of the survivors may be different from those of the original population.
   </li>
   <li>
    Founder effect occurs when a few individuals start, or found, a new population. By chance, allele frequencies of the founders may be different from allele frequencies of the population they left. An example is described in

   The sickle-cell example shows that fitness depends on phenotypes. It also shows that fitness may depend on the environment. What do you think might happen if malaria was eliminated in an African population with a relatively high frequency of the

   <li>
    <strong>
     Stabilizing selection
    </strong>
    occurs when phenotypes at both extremes of the phenotypic distribution are selected against. This narrows the range of variation. An example is human birth weight. Babies that are very large or very small at birth are less likely to survive. This keeps birth weight within a relatively narrow range.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Directional selection
    </strong>
    occurs when one of two extreme phenotypes is selected for. This shifts the distribution toward that extreme. This is the type of natural selection that the Grants observed in the beak size of Gal&#225;pagos finches.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Disruptive selection
    </strong>
    occurs when phenotypes in the middle of the range are selected against. This results in two overlapping phenotypes, one at each end of the distribution. An example is
    <strong>
     sexual dimorphism
    </strong>
    . This refers to differences between the phenotypes of males and females of the same species. In humans, for example, males and females have different heights and body shapes.

   Lesson Summary

  <ul id="x-ck12-NThkZmU4OGUyNTEyOTVjZjg5YjI2NDZlZTkxNWIxYmU.-zbi">
   <li>
    Microevolution occurs over a short period of time in a population or species. Macroevolution occurs over geologic time above the level of the species.
   </li>
   <li>
    The population is the unit of evolution. A population&#8217;s gene pool consists of all the genes of all the members of the population. For a given gene, the population is characterized by the frequency of different alleles in the gene pool.
   </li>
   <li>
    The Hardy-Weinberg theorem states that, if a population meets certain conditions, it will be in equilibrium. In an equilibrium population, allele and genotype frequencies do not change over time. The conditions that must be met are no mutation, no migration, very large population size, random mating, and no natural selection.
   </li>
   <li>
    There are four forces of evolution: mutation, gene flow, genetic drift, and natural selection. Natural selection for a polygenic trait changes the distribution of phenotypes. It may have a stabilizing, directional, or disruptive effect on the phenotype distribution.

   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-NTBkYzQ0MmE5ZGRhZjAwNTNhMmM5Y2E0MWYzN2Y2NTg.-j1m">
   Macroevolution is evolution over geologic time above the level of the species. One of the main topics in macroevolution is how new species arise. The process by which a new species evolves is called
   <strong>
    speciation
   </strong>
   . How does speciation occur? How does one species evolve into two or more new species?
  </p>
  <h2 id="x-ck12-T3JpZ2luIG9mIFNwZWNpZXM._3-lsf">
   Origin of Species
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-NDk3YTIxZWU1OTYxOWMwNjVmNmQyNzQ0YTgwMmI5NDQ.-dqp">
   To understand how a new species forms, it&#8217;s important to review what a species is. A species is a group of organisms that can breed and produce fertile offspring together in nature. For a new species to arise, some members of a species must become reproductively isolated from the rest of the species. This means they can no longer interbreed with other members of the species. How does this happen? Usually they become geographically isolated first.

   Allopatric Speciation

   Assume that some members of a species become geographically separated from the rest of the species. If they remain separated long enough, they may evolve genetic differences. If the differences prevent them from interbreeding with members of the original species, they have evolved into a new species. Speciation that occurs in this way is called
   <strong>
    allopatric speciation
   </strong>

    Apple trees were introduced to the U.S. and often grow near hawthorn trees. Some hawthorn flies started to lay eggs in nearby apple trees. When the eggs hatched, the larvae fed on apples.

   <li>
    Over time, the two fly populations&#8212;those that fed on hawthorn trees and those that preferred apple trees&#8212;evolved reproductive isolation. Now they are reproductively isolated because they breed at different times. Their breeding season matches the season when the apple or hawthorn fruits mature.

    Coevolution occurs when species evolve together. This often happens in species that have symbiotic relationships. Examples include flowering plants and their pollinators.
   </li>
   <li>
    Darwin thought that evolution occurs gradually. This model of evolution is called gradualism. The fossil record better supports the model of punctuated equilibrium. In this model, long periods of little change are interrupted by bursts of rapid change.

   Points to Consider
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-YmFlZDViMTA2ZWQ4ZWY1ZDc3OThkNWY3ZWRiNDE3MDc.-pbz">
   You read in this chapter about adaptive radiation on the Gal&#225;pagos Islands. A single finch species evolved into many new species to fill all available niches. For example, the species evolved adaptations for a variety of food sources.
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-OTVjMDNiZGQzODQ0ODE2NTVlZDhkZjY1NWRmNGU2M2Q.-egr">
   <li>
    What is a species&#8217; niche? What do you think it might include besides the food a species eats?
   </li>
   <li>
    Niche is a term from ecology. What is ecology? How do you think knowledge of ecology might help scientists understand evolution?
   </li>
  </ul>
