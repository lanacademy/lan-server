    These brilliant red &#8220;feathers&#8221; are actually animals called tube worms. They live in an extreme environment on the deep ocean floor, thousands of meters below the water&#8217;s surface. Their world is always very cold and completely dark. Without sunlight, photosynthesis is not possible. So what do organisms eat at these depths? Tube worms depend on chemosynthetic microorganisms that live inside them for food. In this and other ways, tube worms have adapted to the extreme conditions of their environment.

   <p id="x-ck12-MGZmYjc4M2Y3YTg4YWE1MWZkNWMyNWJiZWE5ODFkNGM.-iy7">
    All organisms must adapt to their environment in order to survive. This is true whether they live in water or on land. Most environments are not as extreme as the deep ocean where tube worms live. But they all have conditions that require adaptations. In this chapter, you will read about a wide variety of environments and the organisms that live in them.

   <strong>
    Ecology
   </strong>
   is the study of how living things interact with each other and with their environment. It is a major branch of biology, but has areas of overlap with geography, geology, climatology, and other sciences. This lesson introduces fundamental concepts in ecology, beginning with organisms and the environment.

  <h2 id="x-ck12-T3JnYW5pc21zIGFuZCB0aGUgRW52aXJvbm1lbnQ.-fqi">
   Organisms and the Environment
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZjFhOTg0OGYxOWEyMGUwMWM1YmIxMmQ1ZmEwZjNmM2M.-y8o">
   Organisms are individual living things. Despite their tremendous diversity, all organisms have the same basic needs: energy and matter. These must be obtained from the environment. Therefore, organisms are not closed systems. They depend on and are influenced by their environment. The environment includes two types of factors: abiotic and biotic.
  </p>
  <ol id="x-ck12-MTQ3ZWQ2MDU0NGRlZjQwODllMDhlYjhiNzNjNTEwZDc.-b1s" class="x-ck12-decimal">
   <li>
    <strong>
     Abiotic factors
    </strong>
    are the nonliving aspects of the environment. They include factors such as sunlight, soil, temperature, and water.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Biotic factors
    </strong>
    are the living aspects of the environment. They consist of other organisms, including members of the same and different species.
   </li>

   The Ecosystem
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZmQxMjhkMmZhZWFjMzVhYzA5NjZlYTg1MjhhNTNhYzQ.-zos">
   An ecosystem is a unit of nature and the focus of study in ecology. It consists of all the biotic and abiotic factors in an area and their interactions. Ecosystems can vary in size. A lake could be considered an ecosystem. So could a dead log on a forest floor. Both the lake and log contain a variety of species that interact with each other and with abiotic factors. Another example of an ecosystem is pictured in

   When it comes to energy, ecosystems are not closed. They need constant inputs of energy. Most ecosystems get energy from sunlight. A small minority get energy from chemical compounds. Unlike energy, matter is not constantly added to ecosystems. Instead, it is recycled. Water and elements such as carbon and nitrogen are used over and over again.

   Niche
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZGFiMDgxZTM4M2I3ODg4ODY5Mzg4M2Y5MjBjMTUxZGY.-esd">
   One of the most important concepts associated with the ecosystem is the niche. A
   <strong>
    niche
   </strong>
   refers to the role of a species in its ecosystem. It includes all the ways that the species interacts with the biotic and abiotic factors of the environment. Two important aspects of a species&#8217; niche are the food it eats and how the food is obtained. Look at
   <strong>
    Figure
   </strong>
   <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTExLTAyLWJpcmQtbmljaGVz">

   . It shows pictures of birds that occupy different niches. Each species eats a different type of food and obtains the food in a different way.

    Bird Niches. Each of these species of birds has a beak that suits it for its niche. For example, the long slender beak of the nectarivore allows it to sip liquid nectar from flowers. The short sturdy beak of the granivore allows it to crush hard, tough grains.

   Habitat
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NWEwZThiZTJiYWQwY2NmNzBiNjI1MzdkM2U1NTA3MjY.-8b3">
   Another aspect of a species&#8217; niche is its habitat. The
   <strong>
    habitat
   </strong>
   is the physical environment in which a species lives and to which it is adapted. A habitat&#8217;s features are determined mainly by abiotic factors such as temperature and rainfall. These factors also influence the traits of the organisms that live there.

   Competitive Exclusion Principle
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-Y2RkNGE1YzFkMTNjMzdmNzU0ZjhkODJlNDU0MDlhZTQ.-syr">
   A given habitat may contain many different species, but each species must have a different niche. Two different species cannot occupy the same niche in the same place for very long. This is known as the
   <strong>
    competitive exclusion principle
   </strong>
   . If two species were to occupy the same niche, what do you think would happen? They would compete with one another for the same food and other resources in the environment. Eventually, one species would be likely to outcompete and replace the other.

   Flow of Energy
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-MjUzODFlYzBhNjBmNTE3M2E3ZWY0MzQ1NmRkMWIwMmE.-omu">
   Energy enters ecosystems in the form of sunlight or chemical compounds. Some organisms use this energy to make food. Other organisms get energy by eating the food.

   Producers
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NzM1YWI2OTllZjg3ZjNlMTYwM2Y1OTUxOTg2M2I3ODk.-uge">
   Producers are organisms that produce food for themselves and other organisms. They use energy and simple inorganic molecules to make organic compounds. The stability of producers is vital to ecosystems because all organisms need organic molecules. Producers are also called autotrophs. There are two basic types of autotrophs: photoautotrophs and chemoautotrophs.

  <p id="x-ck12-MjJkZDZmZWIyOWI1N2NhMDk1ODIxYWE0MGE0ZmFhYzc.-tyw">
   Consumers are organisms that depend on other organisms for food. They take in organic molecules by essentially &#8220;eating&#8221; other living things. They include all animals and fungi. (Fungi don't really &#8220;eat&#8221;; they absorb nutrients from other organisms.) They also include many bacteria and even a few plants, such as the pitcher plant in

   Lesson Summary
  </h2>
  <ul id="x-ck12-YWNlYzRkMTc2MThkOTExOTAyZDNmYjlmNmE2MmQxZTM.-mxd">
   <li>
    Ecology is the study of how living things interact with each other and with their environment. The environment includes abiotic (nonliving) and biotic (living) factors.
   </li>
   <li>
    An ecosystem consists of all the biotic and abiotic factors in an area and their interactions. A niche refers to the role of a species in its ecosystem. A habitat is the physical environment in which a species lives and to which it is adapted. Two different species cannot occupy the same niche in the same place for very long.
   </li>
   <li>
    Ecosystems require constant inputs of energy from sunlight or chemicals. Producers use energy and inorganic molecules to make food. Consumers take in food by eating producers or other living things. Decomposers break down dead organisms and other organic wastes and release inorganic molecules back to the environment.
   </li>
   <li>
    Food chains and food webs are diagrams that represent feeding relationships. They model how energy and matter move through ecosystems.
   </li>
   <li>
    The different feeding positions in a food chain or web are called trophic levels. Generally, there are no more than four trophic levels because energy and biomass decrease from lower to higher levels.

   Points to Consider
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-ODI0N2IzZTViNTNjMDNhNWE2NGY3OGM1ZDhmNDRkMDA.-cbp">
   In this lesson, you learned how matter is transferred through food chains and webs. Producers make food from inorganic molecules. Other organisms consume the producers. When organisms die, decomposers break down their remains and release inorganic molecules that can be used again by producers. In this way, matter is recycled by the biotic factors in ecosystems.

   Introduction

   Where does the water come from that is needed by your cells? Or the carbon and nitrogen that is needed to make your organic molecules? Unlike energy, matter is not lost as it passes through an ecosystem. Instead, matter is recycled. This recycling involves specific interactions between the biotic and abiotic factors in an ecosystem.

   Biogeochemical Cycles

   The chemical elements and water that are needed by organisms continuously recycle in ecosystems. They pass through biotic and abiotic components of the biosphere. That&#8217;s why their cycles are called
   <strong>
    biogeochemical cycles
   </strong>
   . For example, a chemical might move from organisms (
   <em>
    bio
   </em>
   ) to the atmosphere or ocean (
   <em>
    geo
   </em>
   ) and back to organisms again. Elements or water may be held for various periods of time in different parts of a cycle.

    Part of a cycle that holds an element or water for a short period of time is called an
    <strong>
     exchange pool
    </strong>
    . For example, the atmosphere is an exchange pool for water. It usually holds water (in the form of water vapor) for just a few days.
   </li>
   <li>
    Part of a cycle that holds an element or water for a long period of time is called a
    <strong>
     reservoir

   </strong>
   is the process in which water vapor changes to tiny droplets of liquid water. The water droplets may form clouds. If the droplets get big enough, they fall as
   <strong>
    precipitation
   </strong>
   &#8212;rain, snow, sleet, hail, or freezing rain. Most precipitation falls into the ocean. Eventually, this water evaporates again and repeats the water cycle. Some frozen precipitation becomes part of ice caps and glaciers. These masses of ice can store frozen water for hundreds of years or longer.

   Groundwater and Runoff

   Precipitation that falls on land may flow over the surface of the ground. This water is called
   <strong>

   Lesson Summary
  </h2>
  <ul id="x-ck12-OWNiZGYyYTI5NTA0YTg2YzQxNzljN2YyNDc5N2UzZDk.-7ma">
   <li>
    Chemical elements and water are recycled through biogeochemical cycles. The cycles include both biotic and abiotic parts of ecosystems.
   </li>
   <li>
    The water cycle takes place on, above, and below Earth&#8217;s surface. In the cycle, water occurs as water vapor, liquid water, and ice. Many processes are involved as water changes state in the cycle. The atmosphere is an exchange pool for water. Ice masses, aquifers, and the deep ocean are water reservoirs.
   </li>
   <li>
    In the carbon cycle, carbon passes among sedimentary rocks, fossil fuel deposits, the ocean, the atmosphere, and living things. Carbon cycles quickly between organisms and the atmosphere. It cycles far more slowly through geological processes.
   </li>
   <li>
    The nitrogen cycle moves nitrogen back and forth between the atmosphere and organisms. Bacteria change nitrogen gas from the atmosphere to nitrogen compounds that plants can absorb. Other bacteria change nitrogen compounds back to nitrogen gas, which re-enters the atmosphere.

   <strong>
    Climate
   </strong>
   is the average weather in an area over a long period of time. Weather refers to the conditions of the atmosphere from day to day. Climate is generally described in terms of temperature and moisture. Temperature falls from the equator to the poles. Therefore, major temperature zones are based on latitude. They include tropical, temperate, and arctic zones (see
   <strong>
    Figure
   </strong>
   <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTExLTE0LXRlbXBlcmF0dXJlLXpvbmVz">

   </a>
   ). However, other factors besides latitude may also influence temperature. For example, land near the ocean may have cooler summers and warmer winters than land farther inland. This is because water gains and loses heat more slowly than does land, and the water temperature influences the temperature on the coast. Temperature also falls from lower to higher altitudes. That&#8217;s why tropical zone mountain tops may be capped with snow.

   In terms of moisture, climates can be classified as arid (dry), semi-arid, humid (wet), or semi-humid. The amount of moisture depends on both precipitation and evaporation. Precipitation increases moisture. Evaporation decreases moisture.

    The global pattern of precipitation is influenced by movements of air masses. For example, there is a global belt of dry air masses and low precipitation at about 30&#176; N and 30&#176; S latitude.
   </li>
   <li>
    Precipitation is also influenced by temperature. Warm air can hold more moisture than cold air, so tropical areas receive more rainfall than other parts of the world.

    is the period of time each year when it is warm and wet enough for plants to grow. The growing season may last all year in a hot, wet climate but just a few months in a cooler or drier climate.
   </li>
   <li>
    Plants grow best in soil that contains plenty of nutrients and organic matter. Both are added to soil when plant litter and dead organisms decompose. Decomposition occurs too slowly in cold climates and too quickly in hot, wet climates for nutrients and organic matter to accumulate. Temperate climates usually have the best soil for plant growth.

It is also usually greater in more humid climates. This is apparent from the desert and rainforest biomes pictured in

   Terrestrial organisms are generally limited by temperature and moisture. Therefore, terrestrial biomes are defined in terms of these abiotic factors.

   Organisms that live deep in the ocean must be able to withstand extreme water pressure, very cold water, and complete darkness. However, even here, thriving communities of living things can be found. Organisms cluster around hydrothermal vents in the ocean floor. The vents release hot water containing chemicals that would be toxic to most other living things. The producers among them are single-celled chemoautotrophs. They make food using energy stored in the chemicals. The tube worms in this chapter's opening photo depend on these chemoautotrophs for food.

   Running freshwater biomes include streams and rivers. Rivers are usually larger than streams. Streams may start with runoff or water seeping out of a spring. The water runs downhill and joins other running water to become a stream. A stream may flow into a river that empties into a lake or the ocean. Running water is better able to dissolve oxygen and nutrients than standing water. However, the moving water is a challenge to many living things. Algae and plants (such as the cattails in

   For more than 100 years, south San Francisco Bay has been a center for industrial salt production. Now federal and state biologists are working to restore the ponds to healthy wetlands for fish and other wildlife. Salt marshes are rich habitats that provide shelter and food for many species, some of which are endangered or threatened.

   KQED: Studying Aquatic Animals
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-M2ZkNjIwYzhhZjFhMjgwYzA5NGEzZTk5ODQ0NmRmYTg.-lcl">
   Oceans cover more than 70 percent of our planet yet they make up one of the least explored regions on Earth. Who better to unlock the mysteries of the ocean than marine animals themselves? Marine scientists have been tagging and tracking sharks, leatherback turtles and other sea life to learn more about marine ecosystems. Through the Tagging of Pacific Predators program (TOPP), scientists hope to both assess and explain the migration routes, ecosystems and diversity of our oceans&#8217; species.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-YmNhMjNhYjk5YzJhMmU4MTdhYjE4MTYzODM0ZmVkODE.-z6w">
   Beginning in 2000, scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Stanford University and the University of California, Santa Cruz combined to form TOPP. As part of TOPP, researchers attach satellite tags to elephant seals, white sharks, giant leatherback turtles, bluefin tuna, swordfish and other marine animals. The tags collect information, such as how deep each animal dives, the levels of ambient light (to help determine an animal&#8217;s location) and interior and exterior body temperature. Some tags also collect information about the temperature, salinity and depth of the water surrounding an animal to help scientists identify ocean currents. The tags send the data to a satellite, which in turn sends the data the scientists. They use this information to create maps of migration patterns and discover new information about different marine ecosystems. The information collected by TOPP offers rare insights into the lives of marine animals. Without TOPP, that information would otherwise remain unknown. With TOPP, scientists are developing a working knowledge of the particular migration routes animals take, as well as the locations of popular breeding grounds and the environmental dangers faced by different species. TOPP has shed light on how we can better protect the leatherback turtle and other endangered species.

  <ul id="x-ck12-OTRmNmQ4ZGEwZmRhMWMzNzcxNjg3MDc5ODZlMDRlMmQ.-38o">
   <li>
    Terrestrial biomes are determined mainly by climate. Climate influences plant growth, biodiversity, and adaptations of land organisms. Terrestrial biomes include tundras, temperate forests and grasslands, chaparral, temperate and tropical deserts, and tropical forests and grasslands.
   </li>
   <li>
    Aquatic biomes are determined mainly by sunlight and concentrations of dissolved oxygen and nutrients in the water. Aquatic organisms are either plankton, nekton, or benthos. Marine biomes are found in the salt water of the ocean. Freshwater biomes include standing and running water biomes. Wetlands are extremely important biomes. They may have freshwater or salt water.
