    You might think that these young tigers are fighting, but they&#8217;re really playing. Like most other young mammals, tigers like to play. Why do mammals play? Is playing just for fun, or does it serve some other purpose as well?
   </p>
   <p id="x-ck12-ZTVjOWIxM2I3MWY0NzU4MGM3NTBiNGIzYTZjOWEwNmI.-jzk">
    Playing is actually an important way of learning. By playing, these tigers are learning moves that will help them become successful predators as adults. Playing is just one of many ways that mammals and other animals learn how to behave. In this chapter, you will learn more about mammals such as tigers. You will also learn more about animal behavior and other ways that animals learn.

    Mammals
   </strong>
   are a class of endothermic vertebrates. They have four limbs and produce amniotic eggs. Examples of mammals include bats, whales, mice, and humans. Clearly, mammals are a very diverse group. Nonetheless, they share many traits that set them apart from other vertebrates.

    Female mammals have
    <strong>
     mammary glands
    </strong>
    . The glands produce milk after the birth of offspring. Milk is a nutritious fluid. It contains disease-fighting molecules as well as all the nutrients a baby mammal needs. Producing milk for an offspring is called
    <strong>
     lactation
    </strong>
    .
   </li>
   <li>
    Mammals have hair or fur. It insulates the body to help conserve body heat. It can also be used for sensing and communicating. For example, cats use their whiskers to sense their surroundings. They also raise their fur to look larger and more threatening (see

   Most mammals share several other traits. The traits in the following list are typical of, but not necessarily unique to, mammals.
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-ZTFjZTMzMmNiYmM3ZDU3OGNmMmU2YWE5ZTVhMDIyNjU.-chs">
   <li>
    The skin of many mammals is covered with sweat glands. The glands produce sweat, the salty fluid that helps cool the body.
   </li>
   <li>
    Mammalian lungs have millions of tiny air sacs called
    <strong>
     alveoli
    </strong>
    . They provide a very large surface area for gas exchange.
   </li>
   <li>
    The heart of a mammal consists of four chambers. This makes it more efficient and powerful for delivering oxygenated blood to tissues.
   </li>
   <li>
    The brain of a mammal is relatively large and has a covering called the
    <strong>
     neocortex
    </strong>
    . This structure plays an important role in many complex brain functions.
   </li>
   <li>
    The mammalian middle ear has three tiny bones that carry sound vibrations from the outer to inner ear. The bones give mammals exceptionally good hearing. In other vertebrates, the three bones are part of the jaw and not involved in hearing.
   </li>
   <li>
    Mammals have four different types of teeth. The teeth of other vertebrates, in contrast, are all alike.

   Structure and Function in Mammals
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZWZiYTY0ZTA4ZDg3OTQ3ODdmYzA2MDFkODdkNGFmZWE.-d53">
   Many structures and functions in mammals are related to endothermy. Mammals can generate and conserve heat when it&#8217;s cold outside. They can also lose heat when they become over-heated. How do mammals control their body temperature in these ways?
  </p>

   How Mammals Stay Warm
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-YTZhYzAzZjcyYTVlOGU3YzkyMDQ0MTM2ZTg5ZjZkMjQ.-e2d">
   Mammals generate heat mainly by keeping their metabolic rate high. The cells of mammals have many more mitochondria than the cells of other animals. The extra mitochondria generate enough energy to keep the rate of metabolism high. Mammals can also generate little bursts of heat by shivering. Shivering occurs when many muscles contract a little bit all at once. Each muscle that contracts produces a small amount of heat.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-YWI1MjRiMmE5ZDE1ZGUxZTYzNzg4MDIxNjdmZTFhOWU.-rhb">
   Conserving heat is also important, especially in small mammals. A small body has a relatively large surface area compared to its overall size. Because heat is lost from the surface of the body, small mammals lose a greater proportion of their body heat than large mammals. Mammals conserve body heat with their hair or fur. It traps a layer of warm air next to the skin. Most mammals can make their hair stand up from the skin, so it becomes an even better insulator (see
   <strong>

   </strong>
   <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTIwLTAyLWdvb3NlYnVtcHM.">

   ). Mammals also have a layer of fat under the skin to help insulate the body. This fatty layer is not found in other vertebrates.

   How Mammals Stay Cool
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-YmY5ZTg0MmYwM2YzZGRmYTgwMDYzN2ViYmYzYjJjYTU.-48m">
   One way mammals lose excess heat is by increasing blood flow to the skin. This warms the skin so heat can be given off to the environment. That&#8217;s why you may get flushed, or red in the face, when you exercise on a hot day. You are likely to sweat as well. Sweating also reduces body heat. Sweat wets the skin, and when it evaporates, it cools the body. Evaporation uses energy, and the energy comes from body heat. Animals with fur, such as dogs, use panting instead of sweating to lose body heat (see
   <strong>

   </strong>

   Eating and Digesting Food
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NTFhZmFiOGI1MjU1YzA2MmIzNDAxMzE5ODRjYjI5MzM.-pfu">
   Maintaining a high metabolic rate takes a lot of energy. The energy must come from food. Therefore, mammals need a nutritious and plentiful diet. The diets of mammals are diverse. Except for leaf litter and wood, almost any kind of organic matter may be eaten by mammals. Some mammals are strictly herbivores or strictly carnivores. However, most mammals will eat other foods if necessary. Some mammals are omnivores. They routinely eat a variety of both plant and animal foods. Most mammals also feed on a variety of other species. The few exceptions include koalas, which feed only on eucalyptus plants, and giant pandas, which feed only on bamboo. Types of mammalian diets and examples of mammals that eat them are given in

   Different diets require different types of digestive systems. Mammals that eat a carnivorous diet generally have a relatively simple digestive system. Their food consists mainly of proteins and fats that are easily and quickly digested. Herbivorous mammals, on the other hand, tend to have a more complicated digestive system. Complex plant carbohydrates such as cellulose are more difficult to digest. Some herbivores have more than one stomach. The stomachs store and slowly digest plant foods.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-YTc4NGIxNWE2ZjUzZmY4ZGQyMzQ4YmFiY2Y3MzIwZjA.-yuu">
   Mammalian teeth are also important for digestion. The four types of teeth are specialized for different feeding functions, as shown in

   Keeping the rate of metabolism high takes a constant and plentiful supply of oxygen. That&#8217;s because cellular respiration, which produces energy, requires oxygen. The lungs and heart of mammals are adapted to meet their oxygen needs.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZTg2M2VlYzIxM2Q1ZjM5MjViODlmMDc3MDZiZTNlN2Y.-1uw">
   The lungs of mammals are unique in having alveoli. These are tiny, sac-like structures. Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of very small blood vessels (see

    Figure
   </strong>
   <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTIwLTA1LWFsdmVvbGk.">

   ). Because there are millions of alveoli in each lung, they greatly increase the surface area for gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream. Human lungs, for example, contain about 300 million alveoli. They give the lungs a total surface area for gas exchange of up to 90 square meters (968 square feet). That&#8217;s about as much surface area as one side of a volleyball court!

   Mammals breathe with the help of a diaphragm. This is the large muscle that extends across the bottom of the chest below the lungs. When the diaphragm contracts, it increases the volume of the chest. This decreases pressure on the lungs and allows air to flow in. When the diaphragm relaxes, it decreases the volume of the chest. This increases pressure on the lungs and forces air out.

   The four-chambered mammalian heart can pump blood in two different directions. The right side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen. The left side of the heart pumps blood containing oxygen to the rest of the body. Because of the dual pumping action of the heart, all of the blood going to body cells is rich in oxygen.

   Mammals are very intelligent. Of all vertebrates, they are the animals that are most capable of learning. Mammalian offspring are fed and taken care of by their parents for a relatively long time. This gives them plenty of time to learn from their parents. By learning, they can benefit from the experiences of their elders. The ability to learn is the main reason that the large mammalian brain evolved. It&#8217;s also the primary reason for the success of mammals.

    Lions live in social groups called prides. Adult females in the pride hunt cooperatively, which is more efficient than hunting alone. Then they share the food with the rest of the pride. For their part, adult males defend the pride&#8217;s territory from other predators.

   Locomotion in Mammals
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MzFiNWMyOWYxMzM1ZjljYzY2MjkwODMwODljM2NkZjI.-qrt">
   Mammals are noted for the many ways they can move about. Generally, their limbs are very mobile. Often, they can be rotated. Many mammals are also known for their speed. The fastest land animal is a predatory mammal. Can you guess what it is? Racing at speeds of up to 112 kilometers (70 miles) per hour, the cheetah wins hands down. In addition, the limbs of mammals let them hold their body up above the ground. That&#8217;s because the limbs are attached beneath the body, rather than at the sides as in reptiles (see

  <ul id="x-ck12-ODllOGYxOWYwMTExYzdiNGViNmY2OWNiNDVkYWRjMTQ.-xda">
   <li>
    Mammals are a class of endothermic vertebrates. They have four limbs and produce amniotic eggs. The mammal class is defined by the presence of mammary glands and hair (or fur). Other traits of mammals include sweat glands in their skin, alveoli in their lungs, a four-chambered heart, and a brain covering called the neocortex.
   </li>
   <li>
    Mammals have several ways of generating and conserving heat, such as a high metabolic rate and hair to trap heat. They also have several ways to stay cool, including sweating or panting. Mammals may be herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores. They have four types of teeth, so they can eat a wide range of foods. Traits of the heart and lungs keep the cells of mammals well supplied with oxygen and nutrients.
   </li>
   <li>
    Mammals have a relatively large brain and a high level of intelligence. They also have many ways of moving about and may move very quickly.

  <p id="x-ck12-ZGU1NTZmMzRjYmNiYjJiMGNmZWMzYWJkNGJjYzA4OWM.-nyu">
   Most mammals are viviparous. Their young are born live. They are born either as relatively large, well-developed fetuses or as tiny, immature embryos. Mammals that are viviparous are called
   <strong>
    therian mammals
   </strong>
   . Only a few mammals lay eggs instead of giving birth to an infant or embryo.

    Placental mammals

   ). The placenta passes oxygen, nutrients, and other useful substances from the mother to the fetus. It also passes carbon dioxide and other wastes from the fetus to the mother. The placenta lets blood from the fetus and mother exchange substances without actually mixing. Thus, it protects the fetus from being attacked by the mother&#8217;s immune system as a &#8220;foreign parasite.&#8221;

   The placenta permits a long period of fetal growth in the uterus. As a result, the fetus can become large and mature before birth. This increases its chances of surviving.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-NmY2NDg2NmU5NjQ1ZmVmZDM4ZDYxOGI1NzFmN2Y0NDY.-mtg">
   On the other hand, supporting a growing fetus is very draining and risky for the mother. The mother has to eat more food to nourish the fetus. She also becomes heavier and less mobile as the fetus gets larger. As a result, she may be less able to escape from predators. Because the fetus is inside her, she can&#8217;t abandon it to save her own life if she is pursued or if food is scarce. Giving birth to a large infant is also risky. It may even result in the mother&#8217;s death.

   The marsupial embryo is nourished inside the uterus with food from a yolk sac instead of through a placenta. The yolk sac stores enough food for the short period of time the embryo remains in the uterus. After the embryo is born, it moves into the mother&#8217;s pouch, where it clings to a nipple. It remains inside the pouch for several months while it continues to grow and develop. Even after the offspring is big enough to leave the pouch, it may often return to the pouch for warmth and nourishment (

   Pros and Cons of Marsupial Reproduction
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-OTYxYjAyZGZhOTk1YjM5MzE0MGU4MTY4YTY1MWFhNTY.-ktx">
   In marsupials, the short period of development within the mother&#8217;s uterus reduces the risk of her immune system attacking the embryo. In addition, the marsupial mother doesn&#8217;t have to eat extra food or carry a large fetus inside her. The risks of giving birth to a large fetus are also avoided. Another pro is that the mother can expel the embryo from her pouch if she is pursued by a predator or if food is scarce. On the other hand, a newborn marsupial is tiny and fragile. Therefore, it may be less likely to survive than a newborn placental mammal.

  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NzczMjljNGE3MmYyYjg5ZTJkMDAxY2NjN2RkODY2NWY.-nkg">
   Most people think of Opossums as scary creatures. Is this because they look kind of funny, walk kind of funny, have beady eyes and sharp teeth, and can emit a very foul odor? Maybe. But what is so different about opossums is that they are the only marsupial in North America.

   But opossums can be beneficial to humans. They use their sharp teeth to crush bone &#8211; which means that they are good getting rid of unwanted rodents in your neighborhood. They have excellent immune systems and they emit that terrible oder for protection. Learn more about opossums at

   Eggs and Lactation in Monotremes
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NjUzZDM0OWE0MTU1NDBhN2ZhMWQwNzVlMzU5Njk3MGY.-zpn">
   Female monotremes lack a uterus and vagina. Instead, they have a cloaca with one opening, like the cloacas of reptiles and birds. The opening is used to excrete wastes as well as lay eggs.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-MjMxMGE0NjU0ZDIyMDBhZDNhZWQ1NDQ4NDNhYWI4YzY.-deu">
   Monotreme eggs have a leathery shell, like the eggs of reptiles. The eggs are retained inside the mother&#8217;s body for at least a couple of weeks. During that time, the mother provides the eggs with nutrients. Platypus females lay their eggs in a burrow. Echidna females have a pouch in which they store their eggs. Female monotremes have mammary glands but lack nipples. Instead, they &#8220;sweat&#8221; milk from a patch on their belly.

   Pros and Cons of Monotreme Reproduction
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MDgwZjAwNzRjM2U2ZDJmNDlhNGUwNmMwMDllNTVkNDg.-ja3">
   The mother&#8217;s risks are less in monotremes than in therian mammals. The mother doesn&#8217;t need to eat more or put herself at risk by carrying and delivering a fetus or an embryo. On the other hand, externally laid eggs are more difficult to protect than an embryo in a pouch or a fetus in a uterus. Therefore, monotreme offspring may be less likely to survive than the offspring of therian mammals.

   Lesson Summary
  </h2>
  <ul id="x-ck12-MzI4NjYwNzA4NzIzYjA0MDhmOTVjMTI3YzhkOWI0N2Q.-brd">
   <li>
    Therian mammals are viviparous. They give birth to an embryo or infant rather than laying eggs. The female reproductive system of a therian mammal includes a uterus and a vagina. There are two groups of therian mammals: placental mammals and marsupials.
   </li>
   <li>
    Placental mammals give birth to a relatively large and mature fetus. This is possible because they have a placenta to nourish the fetus and protect it from the mother&#8217;s immune system. This allows for a long period of growth and development before birth. Because the offspring is relatively large and mature at birth, it has a good chance of surviving. However, carrying and giving birth to a large fetus is risky for the mother. It also requires her to eat more food.
   </li>
   <li>
    Marsupials give birth to a tiny, immature embryo. The embryo then continues to grow and develop in a pouch on the mother&#8217;s belly. This is less risky for the mother. However, the embryo is fragile, so it may be less likely to survive than the fetus of a placental mammal.
   </li>
   <li>
    Monotremes reproduce by laying eggs. They have a cloaca instead of a uterus and vagina. The eggs pass through the opening of the cloaca. This form of reproduction is the least risky for the mother. However, eggs are harder to protect than is an embryo or a fetus in a pouch or uterus. Therefore, monotreme offspring may have a lower chance of surviving than the offspring of therian mammals.

  <p id="x-ck12-MWQ4ZDY4MDQzMTEzZjA1OGY4MWNiNjg4OGE1ZTljMWU.-qlx">
   In 2007, an international team of scientists compared the DNA of almost all known species of living mammals. They used the data to create a supertree of mammalian evolution. The supertree shows that placental mammals started to diversify as early as 95 million years ago.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-OThlZDg0NmI0ZjJlNGZiYTdiMTRkZmY4YmZkYzhhODk.-o6k">
   What explains the diversification of mammals long before the dinosaurs went extinct? What else was happening at that time? One change was a drop in Earth&#8217;s temperature. This may have favored endothermic mammals over ectothermic dinosaurs. Flowering plants were also spreading at that time. They may have provided new and plentiful foods for small mammals or their insect prey.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZDA1MzlhNjgzYmM2ZjM3MzM3NDE3NjRiZGU1Yjc5M2I.-u9y">
   The supertree also shows that another major diversification of mammals occurred about 50 million years ago. Again, worldwide climate change may have been one reason. This time Earth&#8217;s temperature rose. The warmer temperature led to a greater diversity of plants. This would have meant more food for mammals or their prey.

   <li>
    Amniotes called synapsids were the ancestors of mammals. Synapsids named pelycosaurs had some of the traits of mammals by 275 million years ago. Some of them evolved into therapsids, which became widespread during the Permian Period. The few therapsids that survived the Triassic takeover were small, arboreal insect eaters. They were also nocturnal. Being active at night may explain why they survived and evolved still more mammalian traits.
   </li>
   <li>
    Monotremes evolved about 150 million years ago. Like modern monotremes, they had a cloaca and laid eggs. Marsupials evolved about 130 million years ago. They were very small and ate insects and worms. Placental mammals evolved about 110 million years ago. They were also small and climbed trees. Placental mammals became the dominant land mammals. Most marsupials and monotremes died out except in Australia.

   <li>
    Mammals used to be classified on the basis of similarities in structure and function into 17 different orders. Recently, DNA analyses have shown that the traditional orders include mammals that are not closely related. Phylogenetic classification, based on DNA data, groups placental mammals in four superorders. The superorders appear to have become distinct from each other 85&#8211;105 million years ago.

   Studying Animal Behavior
  </h2>

   The branch of biology that studies animal behavior is called
   <strong>
    ethology
   </strong>
   . Ethologists usually study how animals behave in their natural environment, rather than in a lab. They generally try to answer four basic questions about the behaviors they observe:
  </p>
  <ol id="x-ck12-OTA1ZjczMTM3NTgwZDY2YTBmNWZjZDFhNmM3MjZhYWM.-cud" class="x-ck12-decimal">
   <li>
    What causes the behavior? What is the
    <strong>
     stimulus
    </strong>
    , or trigger, for the behavior? What structures and functions of the animal are involved in the behavior?
   </li>
   <li>
    How does the behavior develop? Is it present early in life? Or does it appear only as the animal matures? Are certain experiences needed for the behavior to develop?
   </li>
   <li>
    Why did the behavior evolve? How does the behavior affect the fitness of the animal performing it? How does it affect the survival of the species?
   </li>
   <li>
    How did the behavior evolve? How does it compare with similar behaviors in related species? In what ancestor did the behavior first appear?
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p id="x-ck12-NjYwOGMyNzA4ZWRjMWJiYWUzZGE3YzEzNTA1YzY3MGI.-lxd">
   As you read about animal behavior in the rest of this lesson, think about these four questions. Try to answer the questions for different types of animal behavior.

   Evolution of Animal Behavior
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-NDNkMWQ0YmFjMzljZTMyMTk1ZTJmZDYxM2NmYjQ0ZTg.-xbf">
   To the extent that behaviors are controlled by genes, they may evolve through natural selection. If behaviors increase fitness, they are likely to become more common over time. If they decrease fitness, they are likely to become less common.
  </p>
  <h3 id="x-ck12-TmF0dXJlIHZzLiBOdXJ0dXJl_3-ptb">
   Nature vs. Nurture
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MDlhZTE0ZGE5MzExYTA2ZWZmMjZhY2I4NTc4NjUzYWQ.-9gl">
   Some behaviors seem to be controlled solely by genes. Others appear to be due to experiences in a given environment. Whether behaviors are controlled mainly by genes or by the environment is often a matter of debate. This is called the
   <strong>
    nature-nurture debate
   </strong>
   . Nature refers to the genes an animal inherits. Nurture refers to the environment that the animal experiences. In reality, most animal behaviors are not controlled by nature or nurture. Instead, they are influenced by both nature and nurture. In dogs, for example, the tendency to behave toward other dogs in a certain way is probably controlled by genes. However, the normal behaviors can&#8217;t develop in an environment that lacks other dogs. A puppy raised in isolation from other dogs may never develop the normal behaviors. It may always fear other dogs or act aggressively toward them.

   How Behaviors Evolve
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-YTZkOGFmNmVlNWY0NWM0OWQwMDBkMjljNDJjZWE4MWE.-8fh">
   It&#8217;s easy to see how many common types of behavior evolve. That&#8217;s because they obviously increase the fitness of the animal performing them. For example, when wolves hunt together in a pack, they are more likely to catch prey (see
   <strong>
    Figure
   </strong>
   <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTIwLTIxLXdvbHZlcy1odW50aW5n">

   </a>
   ). Therefore, hunting with others increases a wolf&#8217;s fitness. The wolf is more likely to survive and pass its genes to the next generation by behaving this way.

   The evolution of certain other types of behavior is not as easy to explain. An example is a squirrel chattering loudly to warn other squirrels that a predator is near. This is likely to help the other squirrels avoid the predator. Therefore, it could increase their fitness. But what about the squirrel raises the alarm? This squirrel is more likely to be noticed by the predator. Therefore, the behavior may actually lower this squirrel&#8217;s fitness. How could such a behavior evolve through natural selection?
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZjE1ZGE2NDczZjUxOWY1NDdkNmNjZTQ2MmE0Y2ExZmM.-meh">
   One possible answer is that helping others often means helping close relatives. Close relatives share many of the same genes that they inherited from their common ancestor. As a result, helping a close relative may actually increase the chances that copies of one&#8217;s own genes will be passed to the next generation. In this way, a behavior that puts oneself at risk could actually increase through natural selection. This form of natural selection is called kin selection.

   Behaviors that are closely controlled by genes with little or no environmental influence are called
   <strong>
    innate behaviors

   . These are behaviors that occur naturally in all members of a species whenever they are exposed to a certain stimulus. Innate behaviors do not have to be learned or practiced. They are also called instinctive behaviors. An
   <strong>
    instinct
   </strong>
   is the ability of an animal to perform a behavior the first time it is exposed to the proper stimulus. For example, a dog will drool the first time&#8212;and every time&#8212;it is exposed to food.

   Innate behaviors occur in all animals. However, they are less common in species with higher levels of intelligence. Humans are the most intelligent species, and they have very few innate behaviors. The only innate behaviors in humans are reflexes. A
   <strong>
    reflex
   </strong>
   is a response that always occurs when a certain stimulus is present. For example, a human infant will grasp an object, such as a finger, that is placed in its palm. The infant has no control over this reaction because it is innate. Other than reflexes such as this, human behaviors are learned&#8211;or at least influenced by experience&#8212;rather than being innate.

   <strong>
    Learning
   </strong>
   is a change in behavior that occurs as a result of experience. Compared with innate behaviors, learned behaviors are more flexible. They can be modified to suit changing conditions. This may make them more adaptive than innate behaviors. For example, drivers may have to modify how they drive (a learned behavior) when roads are wet or icy. Otherwise, they may lose control of their vehicle.

   is behavior that is intended to cause harm or pain. It may involve physical violence against other individuals. For example, two male gorillas may fight and use their canine teeth to inflict deep wounds. Expressing aggression this way may lead to serious injury and even death. In many species, display behaviors&#8212;rather than actual physical attacks&#8212;are used to show aggression. This helps prevent injury and death. Male gorillas, for example, are more likely to put on a display of aggression than to attack another male. In fact, gorillas have a whole series of display behaviors that they use to show aggression. They beat on their chest, dash back and forth, and pound the ground with their hands.

Adults may have many mates, or they may mate with just one individual. Mates may stay together only while mating. Or they may stay together for an entire breeding season or even for life. Females are likely to be more selective than males in choosing mates. In many species, males put on courtship displays to encourage females to choose them as mates. For example, to attract a mate, a male bowerbird builds an elaborate nest decorated with hundreds of small blue objects (see

   Parental Care
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-Y2JmNWUwMmYyMGM2OGI2NjQ3NWZiYTY2ODk3NDRlN2U.-fl4">
   In most species of fish, amphibians, and reptiles, parents provide no care to their offspring. In birds and mammals, on the other hand, parental care is common. Most often, the mother provides the care. However, in some species, both parents or just the father may be involved.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-MjI4YzU1NGM0YmVkYzRhMTUzMDkxMjA2NzM1MzE3YzE.-lka">
   Parental care is generally longest and most involved in mammals. Besides feeding and protecting their offspring, parents may teach their offspring skills they will need to survive on their own. For example, meerkat adults teach their pups how to eat scorpions. They show the pups how to safely handle the poisonous insects and how to remove the stingers.

   Lesson Summary
  </h2>
  <ul id="x-ck12-YjA0MTg3MzI1MWQxMjQ1ZjZmNzc3ZGNkMDZmZTZjNTE.-9vz">
   <li>
    The branch of biology that studies animal behavior is called ethology. Ethologists usually study how animals behave in their natural environment. They try to determine the cause of behaviors, how behaviors develop, and how and why behaviors evolve.
   </li>
   <li>
    Most animal behaviors are controlled by both genes and experiences in a given environment. To the extent that behaviors are controlled by genes, they may evolve. Behaviors that improve fitness increase through natural selection.
   </li>
   <li>
    Innate behaviors are instinctive. They are controlled by genes and always occur in the same way. They do not have to be learned or practiced. Innate behaviors generally involve basic life functions, so it&#8217;s important that they be performed correctly.
   </li>
   <li>
    Learning is a change in behavior that occurs as a result of experience. Learned behaviors are adaptive because they are flexible. They can change if the environment changes. Behaviors can be learned in several different ways, including through play.
   </li>
   <li>
    Types of animal behavior include social behaviors such as cooperation, communication such as facial expressions, and cyclic behaviors such as migration. Competition may lead to aggressive behaviors or displays of aggression. Behaviors relating to reproduction include mating, courtship, and parenting behaviors.
   </li>

   Points to Consider
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-YjNhNWE5YmIxNmM1YWVmMDJlYmIyZGQ5Y2VmZDY0N2I.-jmi">
   In this lesson, you learned some of the ways that humans differ from other mammals. For example, humans have a larger and more complex brain than other mammals. That&#8217;s why they are also the most intelligent mammals. The next chapter introduces the biology of the human animal.
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-NWFhMzVhNTYxODNhYTgxMzdlZWY1ZDZiOTAzNzc4YmQ.-fpj">
   <li>
    Besides their big brain and intelligence, how else might humans differ from other mammals?
   </li>
   <li>
    What organs and organ systems do you think make up the human body?
   </li>
