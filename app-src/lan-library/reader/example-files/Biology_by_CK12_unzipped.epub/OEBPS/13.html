    Can you guess what organisms are pictured here? Are they fat green worms on a red leaf? Here&#8217;s a clue: There are more organisms like these than any other on Earth. Here&#8217;s another clue: Each organisms consists of a single cell without a nucleus.

    The organisms are bacteria called

     Salmonella.
    </em>
    If the word Salmonella rings a bell, that&#8217;s probably because
    <em>
     Salmonella
    </em>
    causes human diseases such as food poisoning. Many other types of bacteria also cause human diseases. But not all bacteria are harmful to people. In fact, we could not survive without many of the trillions of bacteria that live in or on the human body. You will learn why when you read this chapter.

   No doubt you&#8217;ve had a sore throat before, and you&#8217;ve probably eaten cheese or yogurt. If so, then you&#8217;ve encountered the fascinating world of prokaryotes. Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms that lack a nucleus. They also lack other membrane-bound organelles. Prokaryotes are tiny and sometimes bothersome, but they are the most numerous organisms on Earth. Without them, the world would be a very different place.

   Evolution and Classification of Prokaryotes

  <p id="x-ck12-NDExYTE1OGE0YWZmYzE2MzZlZjkwMmFiYmFmOTY0ZTE.-get">
   Prokaryotes are currently placed in two domains. A domain is the highest taxon, just above the kingdom. The prokaryote domains are
   <strong>
    Bacteria
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    Archaea
   </strong>
   (see

   ). The third domain is Eukarya. It includes all eukaryotes. Unlike prokaryotes, eukaryotes have a nucleus in their cells.

   It&#8217;s not clear how the three domains are related. Archaea were once thought to be offshoots of Bacteria that were adapted to extreme environments. For their part, Bacteria were considered to be ancestors of Eukarya. Scientists now know that Archaea share several traits with Eukarya that Bacteria do not share (see

   Bacteria are the most diverse and abundant group of organisms on Earth. They live in almost all environments. They are found in the ocean, the soil, and the intestines of animals. They are even found in rocks deep below Earth&#8217;s surface. Any surface that has not been sterilized is likely to be covered with bacteria. The total number of bacteria in the world is amazing. It&#8217;s estimated to be 5 &#215; 10

   ) because they contain chlorophyll. They make food through photosynthesis and release oxygen into the air. These bacteria were probably responsible for adding oxygen to the air on early Earth. This changed the planet&#8217;s atmosphere. It also changed the direction of evolution. Ancient cyanobacteria also may have evolved into the chloroplasts of plant cells.

   Binary fission is a type of asexual reproduction. It occurs when a parent cell splits into two identical daughter cells. This can result in very rapid population growth. For example, under ideal conditions, bacterial populations can double every 20 minutes. Such rapid population growth is an adaptation to an unstable environment. Can you explain why?

The other way is when cells directly exchange DNA (usually plasmids) with other cells. Genetic transfer makes bacteria very useful in biotechnology. It can be used to create bacterial cells that carry new genes.

Consider Lyme disease. It&#8217;s caused by bacteria that normally infect small, wild mammals, such as mice. A tick bites a mouse and picks up the bacteria. The tick may then bite a human who invades the natural habitat. Through the bite, the bacteria are transmitted to the human host.

   Lesson Summary
  </h2>
  <ul id="x-ck12-ZTNiY2EyZmU2Y2IwMGUyYzE5NWMyNDEzMTIwM2M1YTQ.-6kj">
   <li>
    Prokaryotes include Bacteria and Archaea. An individual prokaryote consists of a single cell without a nucleus. Bacteria live in virtually all environments on Earth. Archaea live everywhere on Earth, including extreme environments.
   </li>
   <li>
    Most prokaryotic cells are much smaller than eukaryotic cells. They have a cell wall outside their plasma membrane. Prokaryotic DNA consists of a single loop. Some prokaryotes also have small, circular pieces of DNA called plasmids.
   </li>
   <li>
    Prokaryotes fulfill their carbon and energy needs in various ways. They may be photoautotrophs, chemoautotrophs, photoheterotrophs, or chemoheterotrophs.
   </li>
   <li>
    Aerobic prokaryotes live in habitats with oxygen. Anaerobic prokaryotes live in habitats without oxygen. Prokaryotes may also be adapted to habitats that are hot, moderate, or cold in temperature.
   </li>
   <li>
    Prokaryotic cells grow to a certain size. Then they divide by binary fission. This is a type of asexual reproduction. It produces genetically identical offspring. Genetic transfer increases genetic variation in prokaryotes.
   </li>
   <li>
    Bacteria and humans have many important relationships. Bacteria provide humans with a number of services. They also cause human diseases.
   </li>

   Characteristics of Viruses
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-NjMzMmY1NGM5ZjdiNzdjN2EwOTIzODdmZjE2YWIxZTk.-vu4">
   An individual virus is called a
   <strong>
    virion.
   </strong>
   It is a tiny particle much smaller than a prokaryotic cell. Because viruses do not consist of cells, they also lack cell membranes, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and other cell organelles. Without these structures, they are unable to make proteins or even reproduce on their own. Instead, they must depend on a host cell to synthesize their proteins and to make copies of themselves. Viruses infect and live inside the cells of living organisms. When viruses infect the cells of their host, they may cause disease. For example, viruses cause AIDS, influenza (flu), chicken pox, and the common cold.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZDc3ZGI2YWIxN2Q2ODgyNjgxNWMwZjljMjlhZTgxYjU.-agn">
   Although viruses are not classified as living things, they share two important traits with living things. They have genetic material, and they can evolve. This is why the classification of viruses has been controversial. It calls into question just what it means to be alive. What do you think? How would you classify viruses?

   Some viruses have an envelope of phospholipids and proteins. The envelope is made from portions of the host&#8217;s cell membrane. It surrounds the capsid and helps protect the virus from the host&#8217;s immune system. The envelope may also have receptor molecules that can bind with host cells. They make it easier for the virus to infect the cells.

   Researchers used special filters to remove bacteria from tissues that were infected.

This meant that something even smaller than bacteria was causing the infection.

   Origin of Viruses
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-Zjg4OTNhMGUyODdmYWUyYzAyNzBhNWFmOGNhNTlmMmM.-mgp">
   Where did viruses come from? How did the first viruses arise? The answers to these questions are not known for certain. Several hypotheses have been proposed. The two main hypotheses are stated below. Both may be valid and explain the origin of different viruses.
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-YzMxM2M1MjRhMTMzNGQxNGIyN2E4MTZjNmViODk4MGM.-kvx">
   <li>
    Small viruses started as runaway pieces of nucleic acid that originally came from living cells such as bacteria.
   </li>
   <li>
    Large viruses were once parasitic cells inside bigger host cells. Over time, genes needed to survive and reproduce outside host cells were lost.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="x-ck12-UmVwbGljYXRpb24gb2YgVmlydXNlcw.._1-fdw">
   Replication of Viruses
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-OWRiY2ZlZjdmZGVlMjViZDhmN2UzNGFlZmNkYWQ3YWI.-gux">
   Populations of viruses do not grow through cell division because they are not cells. Instead, they use the machinery and metabolism of a host cell to produce new copies of themselves. After infecting a host cell, a virion uses the cell&#8217;s ribosomes, enzymes, ATP, and other components to replicate. Viruses vary in how they do this. For example:
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-ZDRhOTMwMGFiYmZmZWNjNDEyZGNjMzJhYWNjYWUxODI.-70c">
   <li>
    Some RNA viruses are translated directly into viral proteins in ribosomes of the host cell. The host ribosomes treat the viral RNA as though it were the host&#8217;s own mRNA.
   </li>
   <li>
    Some DNA viruses are first transcribed in the host cell into viral mRNA. Then the viral mRNA is translated by host cell ribosomes into viral proteins.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p id="x-ck12-NjdmMWNlOWUwNzFlNWU4ZjFjZjFiMDQ1OTQ4NDJjMjI.-dmt">
   In either case, the newly made viral proteins assemble to form new virions. The virions may then direct the production of an enzyme that breaks down the host cell wall. This allows the virions to burst out of the cell. The host cell is destroyed in the process. The newly released virus particles are free to infect other cells of the host.

   Viruses and Human Disease

  <p id="x-ck12-OTc0OTczM2I0OGY3NjBkZTI3OGMzYWNjMTY4ZjMxNzA.-rnw">
   Viruses cause many human diseases. In addition to the diseases mentioned above, viruses cause rabies, measles, diarrheal diseases, hepatitis, polio, and cold sores (see

   Control of Viruses
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-NDVhZGEwMGIzM2IyY2VhNzcxNWEyZDFmMmJhODhjOTU.-y6a">
   Viral diseases can be difficult to treat. They live inside the cells of their host, so it is hard to destroy them without killing host cells. Antibiotics also have no effect on viruses. Antiviral drugs are available, but only for a limited number of viruses.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZGI0ZWRmNzcwNTc2Y2M1MDNjY2RjMjBiNmE5ODQ2YTk.-rhu">
   Many viral diseases can be prevented by giving people vaccines (see

   ). A
   <strong>
    vaccine
   </strong>
   is a substance that contains pathogens such as viruses. The pathogens have been changed in some way so they no longer cause disease. However, they can still provoke a response from the host&#8217;s immune system. This results in immunity, or the ability to resist the pathogen. Vaccines have been produced for the viruses that cause measles, chicken pox, mumps, polio, and several other diseases.

    Using a Virus in Gene Therapy. A normal human gene is inserted into a virus. The virus carries the gene into a human host cell. The gene enters the nucleus and becomes part of the DNA. The normal gene can then be used to make normal proteins. It can also be copied and passed to daughter cells in the host.

   Lesson Summary
  </h2>
  <ul id="x-ck12-ZmZmYWI0YTNmY2NkZTNlNDMyMjRmYTM5YmY3NTU5YzU.-2pn">
   <li>
    Viruses are tiny particles, smaller than prokaryotic cells. They are not cells and cannot replicate without help, but they have nucleic acids and can evolve.
   </li>
   <li>
    Viruses can be classified on the basis of capsid shape, presence or absence of an envelope, and type of nucleic acid.
   </li>
   <li>
    Viruses were assumed to exist before they were first seen with an electron microscope in the 1930s. Multiple hypotheses for viral origins have been proposed.
   </li>
   <li>
    After infecting a host cell, a virus uses the cell&#8217;s machinery and metabolism to produce new copies of itself.
   </li>
   <li>
    Viruses cause many human diseases by killing host cells or disturbing their homeostasis. Viruses are not affected by antibiotics. Several viral diseases can be treated with antiviral drugs or prevented with vaccines.
   </li>
   <li>
    Viruses are useful tools in scientific research and medicine. Viruses help us understand molecular biology. They are also used in gene therapy.
