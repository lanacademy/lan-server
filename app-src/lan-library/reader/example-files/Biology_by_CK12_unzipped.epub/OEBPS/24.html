   Introduction

   The immune system protects the body from worms, germs, and other agents of harm. The immune system is like a medieval castle. The outside of the castle was protected by a moat and high stone walls. Inside the castle, soldiers were ready to fight off any invaders that managed to get through the outer defenses. Like a medieval castle, the immune system has a series of defenses. In fact, it has three lines of defense. Only pathogens that are able to get through all three lines of defense can harm the body.

  <p id="x-ck12-ODQ2M2I2OThhOGY5NGE1ZDg1ODgxNGZlMWIxMjU5ZDA.-mp5">
   The body&#8217;s first line of defense consists of different types of barriers that keep most pathogens out of the body.
   <strong>
    Pathogens

   Mechanical Barriers
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MGVjYTY4YjQxOTE4NWIzOGQ3MWYxZjVmZDk1Y2QwNTY.-jyp">
   Mechanical barriers physically block pathogens from entering the body. The skin is the most important mechanical barrier. In fact, it is the single most important defense the body has. The outer layer of the skin is tough and very difficult for pathogens to penetrate.
   <strong>
    Mucous membranes
   </strong>
   provide a mechanical barrier at body openings. They also line the respiratory, GI, urinary, and reproductive tracts. Mucous membranes secrete
   <strong>
    mucus
   </strong>
   , a slimy substance that traps pathogens. The membranes also have hair-like cilia. The cilia sweep mucus and pathogens toward body openings where they can be removed from the body. When you sneeze or cough, pathogens are removed from the nose and throat (see

    Figure
   </strong>
   <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTI0LTAyLVNuZWV6ZQ..">

   Chemical Barriers
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-YzY5MWYwNmE2ODg0YWU4MmZjODRlMzdiODIxYjBlZmM.-ej9">
   Chemical barriers destroy pathogens on the outer body surface, at body openings, and on inner body linings. Sweat, mucus, tears, and saliva all contain enzymes that kill pathogens. Urine is too acidic for many pathogens, and semen contains zinc, which most pathogens cannot tolerate. In addition, stomach acid kills pathogens that enter the GI tract in food or water.

   Biological barriers are living organisms that help protect the body. Millions of harmless bacteria live on the human skin. Many more live in the GI tract. The harmless bacteria use up food and space so harmful bacteria cannot grow.

   If you have a cut on your hand, the break in the skin provides a way for pathogens to enter your body. Assume bacteria enter through the cut and infect the wound. These bacteria would then encounter the body&#8217;s second line of defense.

   The cut on your hand may become red, warm, and swollen. These are signs of an

   Introduction

  <p id="x-ck12-ZDhlMzE1ODViMWNlYzBiOTZiZTZmM2U5YzE3NTI2MTM.-pvn">
   Like the immune systems of other vertebrates, the human immune system is adaptive. If pathogens manage to get through the body&#8217;s first two lines of defense, the third line of defense takes over. The third line of defense is referred to as the
   <strong>
    immune response.
   </strong>
   This defense is specific to a particular pathogen, and it allows the immune system to &#8220;remember&#8221; the pathogen after the infection is over. If the pathogen tries to invade the body again, the immune response against that pathogen will be much faster and stronger. You can watch an overview of the immune response at this link:

   The immune response mainly involves the lymphatic system. The
   <strong>
    lymphatic system
   </strong>
   is a major part of the immune system. It produces leukocytes called lymphocytes.
   <strong>
    Lymphocytes
   </strong>
   are the key cells involved in the immune response. They recognize and help destroy particular pathogens in body fluids and cells. They also destroy certain cancer cells. You can watch an animation of the lymphatic system at this link:

   Lymphatic vessels make up a body-wide circulatory system. The fluid they circulate is lymph.
   <strong>
    Lymph
   </strong>
   is a fluid that leaks out of capillaries into spaces between cells. As the lymph accumulates between cells, it diffuses into tiny lymphatic vessels. The lymph then moves through the lymphatic system from smaller to larger vessels. It finally drains back into the bloodstream in the chest. As lymph passes through the lymphatic vessels, pathogens are filtered out at small structures called
   <strong>
    lymph nodes

   The human body has as many as two trillion lymphocytes, and lymphocytes make up about 25% of all leukocytes. The majority of lymphocytes are found in the lymphatic system, where they are most likely to encounter pathogens. The rest are found in the blood. There are two major types of lymphocytes, called
   <strong>
    B cells
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    T cells.
   </strong>
   These cells get their names from the organs in which they mature. B cells mature in bone marrow, and T cells mature in the thymus. Both B and T cells recognize and respond to particular pathogens.

   B and T cells actually recognize and respond to antigens on pathogens. Antigens are molecules that the immune system recognizes as foreign to the body. Antigens are also found on cancer cells and the cells of transplanted organs. They trigger the immune system to react against the cells that carry them. This is why a transplanted organ may be rejected by the recipient&#8217;s immune system. How do B and T cells recognize specific antigens? They have receptor molecules on their surface that bind only with particular antigens. As shown in

   . First, a B cell encounters its matching antigen and engulfs it. The B cell then displays fragments of the antigen on its surface. This attracts a helper T cell (which is further discussed below). The helper T cell binds to the B cell at the antigen site and releases cytokines that &#8220;tell&#8221; the B cell to develop into a plasma cell.

   <strong>
    Active immunity
   </strong>
   results when an immune response to a pathogen produces memory cells. As long as the memory cells survive, the pathogen will be unable to cause a serious infection in the body. Some memory cells last for a lifetime and confer permanent immunity. Active immunity can also result from immunization.
   <strong>
    Immunization
   </strong>
   is the deliberate exposure of a person to a pathogen in order to provoke an immune response and the formation of memory cells specific to that pathogen. The pathogen is often injected. However, only part of a pathogen, a weakened form of the pathogen, or a dead pathogen is typically used. This causes an immune response without making the immunized person sick. This is how you most likely became immune to measles, mumps, and chicken pox. You can watch an animation showing how immunization brings about immunity at this link:

   <strong>
    Passive immunity
   </strong>
   results when antibodies are transferred to a person who has never been exposed to the pathogen. Passive immunity lasts only as long as the antibodies survive in body fluids. This is usually between a few days and a few months. Passive immunity may be acquired by a fetus through its mother&#8217;s blood. It may also be acquired by an infant though the mother&#8217;s breast milk. Older children and adults can acquire passive immunity through the injection of antibodies.

    The body&#8217;s third line of defense is the immune response. This involves the lymphatic system. This system filters pathogens from lymph and produces lymphocytes.
   </li>
   <li>
    Lymphocytes are the key cells in the immune response. They are leukocytes that become activated by a particular antigen. There are two major type of lymphocytes: B cells and T cells.
   </li>
   <li>
    Activated B cells produce antibodies to a particular antigen. Memory B cells remain in the body after the immune response is over and provide immunity to pathogens bearing the antigen.
   </li>
   <li>
    Activated T cells destroy certain cancer cells and cells infected by viruses. Memory T cells remain in the body after the immune response and provide antigen-specific immunity to the virus.
   </li>
   <li>
    Immunity is the ability to resist infection by a pathogen. Active immunity results from an immune response to a pathogen and the formation of memory cells. Passive immunity results from the transfer of antibodies to a person who has not been exposed to the pathogen.

   Introduction

   Your immune system usually protects you from pathogens and keeps you well. However, like any other body system, the immune system itself can develop problems. Sometimes it responds to harmless foreign substances as though they were pathogens. Sometimes it attacks the body&#8217;s own cells. Certain diseases can also attack and damage the immune system and interfere with its ability to defend the body.

   The symptoms of allergies can range from mild to severe. Mild allergy symptoms are often treated with antihistamines. These are drugs that reduce or eliminate the effects of the histamines that cause allergy symptoms. The most severe allergic reaction is called anaphylaxis. This is a life-threatening response caused by a massive release of histamines. It requires emergency medical treatment. You can watch an animated video about how allergic reactions occur and how antihistamines can control them at this link:

   Why does the immune system attack body cells? In some cases, it&#8217;s because of exposure to pathogens that have antigens similar to the body&#8217;s own molecules. When this happens, the immune system not only attacks the pathogens. It also attacks body cells with the similar molecules.

   <strong>
    Immunodeficiency
   </strong>
   occurs when the immune system is not working properly. As a result, it cannot fight off pathogens that a normal immune system would be able to resist. Rarely, the problem is caused by a defective gene. More often, it is acquired during a person&#8217;s lifetime. Immunodeficiency may occur for a variety of reasons:
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-NzgyMjViMWNiNWJiZDkxMjc2NzRjNjdiNDA2OWY2NTM.-wng">
   <li>
    The immune system naturally becomes less effective as people get older. This is why older people are generally more susceptible to disease.
   </li>
   <li>
    The immune system may be damaged by other disorders, such as obesity or drug abuse.
   </li>
   <li>
    Certain medications can suppress the immune system. This is an intended effect of drugs given to people with transplanted organs. In many cases, however, it is an unwanted side effect of drugs used to treat other diseases.
   </li>
   <li>
    Some pathogens attack and destroy cells of the immune system. An example is the virus known as HIV. It is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in the world today. Compromised immune systems are discussed at

It can also be transmitted through an infected mother&#8217;s blood to her baby during late pregnancy or birth or through breast milk after birth. In the past, HIV was also transmitted through blood transfusions. Because donated blood is now screened for HIV, the virus is no longer transmitted this way.

As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections. Medicines can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at present for HIV infections or AIDS. There also is no vaccine to immunize people against HIV infection, but scientists are working to develop one.

   ). Opportunistic diseases are infections and tumors that are rare except in people with immunodeficiency. The diseases take advantage of the opportunity presented by people whose immune systems can&#8217;t fight back. Opportunistic diseases are usually the direct cause of death of people with AIDS.

   . AIDS and HIV were first identified in 1981. Scientists think that the virus originally infected monkeys but then jumped to human populations, probably sometime during the early to mid-1900s. This most likely occurred in West Africa, but the virus soon spread around the world (see

   ). Since then, HIV has killed more than 25 million people worldwide. The hardest hit countries are in Africa, where medicines to slow down the virus are least available. The worldwide economic toll of HIV and AIDS has also been enormous.

   Over the past 15 years, the number of people who die of AIDS each year in the United States has dropped by 70 percent. But AIDS remains a serious public health crisis among low-income African-Americans, particularly women. And in sub-Saharan Africa, the virus killed more than 1.6 million people in 2007. Innovative research approaches could lead to new treatments and possibly a cure for AIDS. HIV/AIDS has been described as a disease of poverty. Individuals with poor access to health care are less likely to see a doctor early on in their HIV infection, and thus they may be more likely to transmit the infection. HIV is now the leading cause of death for African American women between 24 and 35 years old.

   For patients who have access to drugs, infection with the virus ceased to be a death sentence in 1995, when combinations of drugs called highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were developed. For some patients, drugs can reduce the amount of virus to undetectable levels. But some amount of virus always hides in the body's immune cells and attacks again if the patient stops taking their medication. Researchers are working on developing a drug to wipe out this hidden virus, which could mean the end of AIDS. See

   <li>
    Allergies occur when the immune system makes an inflammatory response to a harmless antigen. An antigen that causes an allergy is called an allergen.
   </li>
   <li>
    Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system fails to distinguish self from non-self. As a result, the immune system attacks the body&#8217;s own cells.
   </li>
   <li>
    In an immunodeficiency disease, the immune system does not work normally. As a consequence, it cannot defend the body.
   </li>
   <li>
    HIV is a virus that attacks cells of the immune system and eventually causes AIDS. It is the chief cause of immunodeficiency in the world today.

   How Cancer Occurs
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MGMzN2RiNjlhMDg2N2I1NjY1NDc3M2JjOGE4Nzg2ZmQ.-sex">
   Mutations that lead to cancer usually occur in genes that control the cell cycle. These include tumor-suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes.
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-YTU1MjBkZGVhOGU4YTA2N2Y4NjQ0ZmM5OGIyMGQwZGY.-ynf">
   <li>
    Tumor-suppressor genes normally prevent cells with damaged DNA from dividing. Mutations in these genes prevent them from functioning normally. As a result, cells with damaged DNA are allowed to divide.
   </li>
   <li>
    Proto-oncogenes normally help control cell division. Mutations in these genes turn them into oncogenes. Oncogenes promote the division of cells with damaged DNA.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p id="x-ck12-OTUxMTNhNTJhZmFjOGQxNWQ1YTFjNjc4OGEwZGI1OTA.-frs">
   Cells that divide uncontrollably may form a tumor, or abnormal mass of cells. Tumors may be benign or malignant. Benign tumors remain localized and generally do not harm health. Malignant tumors are cancerous. There are no limits to their growth, so they can invade and damage neighboring tissues. Cells from malignant tumors may also break away from the tumor and enter the bloodstream. They are carried to other parts of the body, where new tumors may form. The most common and the most deadly cancers for U.S. adults are listed in

   Most cancers can be treated, and some can be cured. The general goal of treatment is to remove the tumor without damaging other cells. A cancer patient is typically treated in more than one way. Possible treatments include surgery, drugs (chemotherapy), and radiation. Early diagnosis and treatment of cancer lead to the best chance for survival. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to know the following warning signs of cancer:

   Indoor air may be even more polluted than outdoor air. It may contain harmful substances such as mold, bacteria, and radon. It may also contain carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is a gas produced by furnaces and other devices that burn fuel. If it is inhaled, it replaces oxygen in the blood and quickly leads to death. Carbon monoxide is colorless and odorless, but it can be detected with a carbon monoxide detector like the one in

    Bioterrorism
   </strong>
   is the intentional release or spread of agents of disease. The agents may be viruses, bacteria, or toxins produced by bacteria. The agents may spread through the air, food, or water; or they may come into direct contact with the skin. Two of the best known bioterrorism incidents in the U.S. occurred early in this century:

    In 2001, letters containing anthrax spores were mailed to several news offices and two U.S. Senate offices. A total of 22 people were infected, and 5 of them died of anthrax.
   </li>
   <li>
    In 2003, a deadly toxin called ricin was detected in a letter addressed to the White House. The letter was intercepted at a mail-handling facility off White House grounds. Fortunately, the ricin toxin did not cause any illnesses or deaths.
