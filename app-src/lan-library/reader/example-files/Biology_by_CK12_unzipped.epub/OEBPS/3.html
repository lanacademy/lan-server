    What is this incredible object? Would it surprise you to learn that it represents a human cell? The image represents a cell, similar to one that may be produced by a type of modern microscope called an electron microscope. Without this technology, we wouldn&#8217;t be able to see the structures inside cells. Cells may be small in size, but they are extremely important to life. Like all other living things, you are made of cells. Cells are the basis of life, and without cells, life as we know it would not exist. You will learn more about these amazing building blocks of life when you read this chapter.

   Introduction

   If you look at living matter with a microscope&#8212;even a simple light microscope&#8212;you will see that it consists of cells. Cells are the basic units of the structure and function of living things. They are the smallest units that can carry out the processes of life. All organisms are made up of one or more cells, and all cells have many of the same structures and carry out the same basic life processes. Knowing the structures of cells and the processes they carry out is necessary to understanding life itself.

   Discovery of Cells

   The first time the word
   <em>
    cell
   </em>
   was used to refer to these tiny units of life was in 1665 by a British scientist named Robert Hooke. Hooke was one of the earliest scientists to study living things under a microscope. The microscopes of his day were not very strong, but Hooke was still able to make an important discovery. When he looked at a thin slice of cork under his microscope, he was surprised to see what looked like a honeycomb. Hooke made the drawing in

   Leeuwenhoek&#8217;s Discoveries

   Soon after Robert Hooke discovered cells in cork, Anton van Leeuwenhoek in Holland made other important discoveries using a microscope. Leeuwenhoek made his own microscope lenses, and he was so good at it that his microscope was more powerful than other microscopes of his day. In fact, Leeuwenhoek&#8217;s microscope was almost as strong as modern light microscopes. Using his microscope, Leeuwenhoek discovered tiny animals such as rotifers. The magnified image of a rotifer in

   <em>
    animalcules
   </em>
   (&#8220;tiny animals&#8221;). Today, we call Leeuwenhoek&#8217;s animalcules bacteria.

   The Cell Theory
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-YzcwYjMzM2NmZjZjZjc1MmU2MDk1ZDVlMDYzYjdjZDA.-wnz">
   By the early 1800s, scientists had observed the cells of many different organisms. These observations led two German scientists, named Theodor Schwann and Matthias Jakob Schleiden, to propose that cells are the basic building blocks of all living things. Around 1850, a German doctor named Rudolf Virchow was studying cells under a microscope when he happened to see them dividing and forming new cells. He realized that living cells produce new cells through division. Based on this realization, Virchow proposed that living cells arise only from other living cells. The ideas of all three scientists&#8212;Schwann, Schleiden, and Virchow&#8212;led to the cell theory, which is one of the fundamental theories of biology. The cell theory states that:
  </p>

    All cells come from already existing cells.

   Microscopes
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MDNkMDVkMGMxNDE3NTg4YzFkZWUzNmY5MDI3OTM3YjM.-kgw">
   Starting with Robert Hooke in the 1600s, the microscope opened up an amazing new world&#8212;the world of life at the level of the cell. As microscopes continued to improve, more discoveries were made about the cells of living things. However, by the late 1800s, light microscopes had reached their limit. Objects much smaller than cells, including the structures inside cells, were too small to be seen with even the strongest light microscope. Then, in the 1950s, a new type of microscope was invented. Called the electron microscope, it used a beam of electrons instead of light to observe extremely small objects. With an electron microscope, scientists could finally see the tiny structures inside cells. In fact, they could even see individual molecules and atoms. The electron microscope had a huge impact on biology. It allowed scientists to study organisms at the level of their molecules and led to the emergence of the field of molecular biology. With the electron microscope, many more cell discoveries were made.

   Diversity of Cells
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-NzMzMDYyZWM5NTUxNDhkYjViYjlhYWVmOTk3ZDQ4Y2M.-0fv">
   Today, we know that all living cells have certain things in common. For example, all cells share functions such as obtaining and using energy, responding to the environment, and reproducing. We also know that different types of cells&#8212;even within the same organism&#8212;may have their own unique functions as well. Cells with different functions generally have different shapes that suit them for their particular job. Cells vary in size as well as shape, but all cells are very small. In fact, most cells are much smaller than the period at the end of this sentence. If cells have such an important role in living organisms, why are they so small? Even the largest organisms have microscopic cells. What limits cell size?
  </p>
  <h3 id="x-ck12-Q2VsbCBTaXpl-eil">
   Cell Size
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZDNmMGQwNTQ1OGY2ZDIzYzExZjE3ZDZjMWRmZTI2OTU.-nvd">
   The answer to these questions is clear once you know how a cell functions. To carry out life processes, a cell must be able to quickly pass substances into and out of the cell. For example, it must be able to pass nutrients and oxygen into the cell and waste products out of the cell. Anything that enters or leaves a cell must cross its outer surface. It is this need to pass substances across the surface that limits how large a cell can be. Look at the two cubes in
   <strong>
    Figure
   </strong>
   <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTAzLTA0LXN1cmZhY2UtYXJlYS12b2x1bWU.">
    below
   </a>
   . As this figure shows, a larger cube has less surface area relative to its volume than a smaller cube. This relationship also applies to cells; a larger cell has less surface area relative to its volume than a smaller cell. A cell with a larger volume also needs more nutrients and oxygen and produces more wastes. Because all of these substances must pass through the surface of the cell, a cell with a large volume will not have enough surface area to allow it to meet its needs. The larger the cell is, the smaller its ratio of surface area to volume, and the harder it will be for the cell to get rid of its wastes and take in necessary substances. This is what limits the size of the cell.

   are just a few examples of the many different shapes that cells may have. Each type of cell in the figure has a shape that helps it do its job. For example, the job of the nerve cell is to carry messages to other cells. The nerve cell has many long extensions that reach out in all directions, allowing it to pass messages to many other cells at once. Do you see the tail-like projections on the algae cells? Algae live in water, and their tails help them swim. Pollen grains have spikes that help them stick to insects such as bees. How do you think the spikes help the pollen grains do their job? (

   Viruses contain DNA but not much else. They lack the other parts shared by all cells, including a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and ribosomes. Therefore, viruses are not cells, but are they alive? All living things not only have cells; they are also capable of reproduction. Viruses cannot reproduce by themselves. Instead, they infect living hosts, and use the hosts&#8217; cells to make copies of their own DNA. For these reasons, most scientists do not consider viruses to be living things.

   Lesson Summary
  </h2>
  <ul id="x-ck12-NjFhNmUzZDk4N2I4NWViN2IyZDdlNTFkNjczMWExZTY.-ogp">
   <li>
    Discoveries about cells using the microscope led to the development of the cell theory. This theory states that all organisms are made of one or more cells, all the life functions of organisms occur within cells, and all cells come from already existing cells.
   </li>
   <li>
    All cells are very small because they need to pass substances across their surface. Their small size gives them a relatively large ratio of surface area to volume, facilitating the transfer of substances. The shapes of cells may vary, and a cell&#8217;s shape generally suits its function.
   </li>
   <li>
    Cells are diverse, but all cells contain a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and DNA.
   </li>
   <li>
    Prokaryotic cells are cells without a nucleus. They are found in single-celled organisms. Eukaryotic cells are cells with a nucleus and other organelles. They are found mainly in multicellular organisms.

How do your cells carry out these basic functions and keep themselves&#8212;and you&#8212;alive? To answer these questions, you need to know more about the structures that make up cells.

   The Plasma Membrane

   The plasma membrane forms a barrier between the cytoplasm inside the cell and the environment outside the cell. It protects and supports the cell and also controls everything that enters and leaves the cell. It allows only certain substances to pass through, while keeping others in or out. The ability to allow only certain molecules in or out of the cell is referred to as selective permeability or semipermeability. To understand how the plasma membrane controls what crosses into or out of the cell, you need to know its composition.

   , each phospholipid molecule has a head and two tails. The head &#8220;loves&#8221; water (hydrophilic) and the tails &#8220;hate&#8221; water (hydrophobic). The water-hating tails are on the interior of the membrane, whereas the water-loving heads point outwards, toward either the cytoplasm or the fluid that surrounds the cell. Molecules that are hydrophobic can easily pass through the plasma membrane, if they are small enough, because they are water-hating like the interior of the membrane. Molecules that are hydrophilic, on the other hand, cannot pass through the plasma membrane&#8212;at least not without help&#8212;because they are water-loving like the exterior of the membrane.

Scientists think that mitochondria were once free-living organisms because they contain their own DNA.

The larger cells provided the smaller prokaryotes with a place to live. In return, the larger cells got extra energy from the smaller prokaryotes. Eventually, the prokaryotes became permanent

   Levels of Organization in Multicellular Organisms
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NTU4OTZmNTBhZjQ4YTMzMWUzZjAzZjE4YWI0NThmZmU.-5nh">
   Scientists think that multicellular organisms evolved when many single-celled organisms of the same species started to work together and benefited from the relationship. The oldest known multicellular organisms are algae that lived 1.2 billion years ago. As multicellular organisms continued to evolve, they developed increasingly complex levels of organization. Today there are multicellular organisms at all levels of organization, from the simplest, cell level of organization to the most complex, organ-system level of organization. Consider these examples:
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-MWI3NGEzMGFiZTRlNmEzOGExZDZmOGQ1Mjg5ZmYxNzE.-zlh">
   <li>
    Sponges have cell-level organization, in which different cells are specialized for different functions, but each cell works alone. For example, some cells digest food, while other cells let water pass through the sponge.
   </li>
   <li>
    Jellyfish have tissue-level organization, in which groups of cells of the same kind that do the same job form tissues. For example, jellyfish have some tissues that digest food and other tissues that sense the environment.
   </li>
   <li>
    Roundworms have organ-level organization, in which two or more types of tissues work together to perform a particular function as an organ. For example, a roundworm has a primitive brain that controls how the organism responds to the environment.
   </li>
   <li>
    Human beings have organ system-level organization, in which groups of organs work together to do a certain job, with each organ doing part of the overall task. An example is the human digestive system. Each digestive system organ&#8212;from the mouth to the small intestine&#8212;does part of the overall task of breaking down food and absorbing nutrients.

  <ul id="x-ck12-ZTU3ZWU3Y2Q1NDczMDY0OGIzNWMyZmM5NWM2MGY0Zjg.-ig0">
   <li>
    The plasma membrane is a phospholipid bilayer that supports and protects a cell and controls what enters and leaves it.
   </li>
   <li>
    The cytoplasm consists of everything inside the plasma membrane, including watery cytosol and organelles. The cytoplasm suspends the organelles and does other jobs. The cytoskeleton crisscrosses the cytoplasm and gives the cell an internal framework.
   </li>
   <li>
    The nucleus is the largest organelle in a eukaryotic cell and contains most of the cell&#8217;s DNA. Other organelles in eukaryotic cells include the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, Golgi apparatus, vesicles, vacuoles, and centrioles (in animal cells only). Each type of organelle has important functions in the cell.
   </li>
   <li>
    Plant cells have special structures that are not found in animal cells, including a cell wall, a large central vacuole, and organelles called plastids.
   </li>
   <li>
    Cells can exist independently as single-celled organisms or with other cells as multicellular organisms. Cells of a multicellular organism can be organized at the level of cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems.

   Introduction

  <p id="x-ck12-NmU0YzkyMjFlNmVmMzRmYWMzMjlkMGFmYTNlZGYxNjU.-kif">
   Imagine living in a house that has walls without any windows or doors. Nothing could enter or leave the house. Now imagine living in a house with holes in the walls instead of windows and doors. Things could enter or leave the house, but you wouldn&#8217;t be able to control what came in or went out. Only if a house has walls with windows and doors that can be opened or closed can you control what enters or leaves. For example, windows and doors allow you to let the dog in and keep the bugs out.

   Transport Across Membranes
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-YTIzMjM4ODk3YTAzMGUxNGIwZDQ2MzA0NWM3MGYwMTM.-xsd">
   If a cell were a house, the plasma membrane would be walls with windows and doors. Moving things in and out of the cell is an important role of the plasma membrane. It controls everything that enters and leaves the cell. There are two basic ways that substances can cross the plasma membrane: passive transport and active transport.

   Passive Transport
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-YWIyYTM2MzQzNTk2ZTAzY2M0ZDM3NzVkYmRiN2MzNDA.-nav">
   <strong>
    Passive transport
   </strong>
   occurs when substances cross the plasma membrane without any input of energy from the cell. No energy is needed because the substances are moving from an area where they have a higher concentration to an area where they have a lower concentration. Concentration refers to the number of particles of a substance per unit of volume. The more particles of a substance in a given volume, the higher the concentration. A substance always moves from an area where it is more concentrated to an area where it is less concentrated. It&#8217;s a little like a ball rolling down a hill. It goes by itself without any input of extra energy.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZjdjZTMwODNiZWMzYTg4ZWFlN2YyMTViMjYxMTg1NmU.-spt">
   There are several different types of passive transport, including simple diffusion, osmosis, and facilitated diffusion. Each type is described below. You can also watch an animation of each type at this link:

   <strong>
    Diffusion
   </strong>
   is the movement of a substance across a membrane, due to a difference in concentration, without any help from other molecules. The substance simply moves from the side of the membrane where it is more concentrated to the side where it is less concentrated.

   <strong>
    Active transport

Energy is needed because the substance is moving from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration. This is a little like moving a ball uphill; it can&#8217;t be done without adding energy. The energy for active transport comes from the energy-carrying molecule called ATP.

    The sodium-potassium pump. The sodium-potassium pump moves sodium ions (Na+) out of the cell and potassium ions (K+) into the cell. First, three sodium ions bind with a carrier protein in the cell membrane. Then, the carrier protein receives a phosphate group from ATP. When ATP loses a phosphate group, energy is released. The carrier protein changes shape, and as it does, it pumps the three sodium ions out of the cell. At that point, two potassium ions bind to the carrier protein. The process is reversed, and the potassium ions are pumped into the cell.

   . Vesicle transport requires energy, so it is also a form of active transport. There are two types of vesicle transport: endocytosis and exocytosis. Both types are shown in

   <li>
    <strong>
     Endocytosis
    </strong>
    is the type of vesicle transport that moves a substance into the cell. The plasma membrane completely engulfs the substance, a vesicle pinches off from the membrane, and the vesicle carries the substance into the cell. When an entire cell is engulfed, the process is called phagocytosis. When fluid is engulfed, the process is called pinocytosis.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Exocytosis
    </strong>
    is the type of vesicle transport that moves a substance out of the cell. A vesicle containing the substance moves through the cytoplasm to the cell membrane. Then, the vesicle membrane fuses with the cell membrane, and the substance is released outside the cell. You can watch an animation of exocytosis at the link below.

   Homeostasis and Cell Function
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-Njk0YTM0NjJkYzE0YzU1YmUxMzA0YWRmMzkzMzE4MTk.-lqx">
   For a cell to function normally, a stable state must be maintained inside the cell. For example, the concentration of salts, nutrients, and other substances must be kept within a certain range. The process of maintaining stable conditions inside a cell (or an entire organism) is homeostasis. Homeostasis requires constant adjustments, because conditions are always changing both inside and outside the cell. The processes described in this lesson play important roles in homeostasis. By moving substances into and out of cells, they keep conditions within normal ranges inside the cells and the organism as a whole.

   Lesson Summary
  </h2>
  <ul id="x-ck12-MzM2YmJhNDhkYWU4NGUwMDg5NzA5NDg5NjA3YjljYzY.-ib3">
   <li>
    A major role of the plasma membrane is transporting substances into and out of the cell. There are two major types of cell transport: passive transport and active transport.
   </li>
   <li>
    Passive transport requires no energy. It occurs when substances move from areas of higher to lower concentration. Types of passive transport include simple diffusion, osmosis, and facilitated diffusion.
   </li>
   <li>
    Active transport requires energy from the cell. It occurs when substances move from areas of lower to higher concentration or when very large molecules are transported. Types of active transport include ion pumps, such as the sodium-potassium pump, and vesicle transport, which includes endocytosis and exocytosis.
   </li>
   <li>
    Cell transport helps cells maintain homeostasis by keeping conditions within normal ranges inside all of an organism&#8217;s cells.

   Points to Consider
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-NDM1NWU3YmFjMzBlMzEzYTU2MWM5ZDQ4NjcwYWViN2M.-jqc">
   All cells share some of the same structures and basic functions, but cells also vary.
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-MzIwNTNhMWJlOWIzMTJhOTA1MmMxMTcyNjA3MDJlZjc.-bfp">
   <li>
    Plant cells have structures that animal cells lack. What important process takes place in plant cells but not in animal cells that might explain their differences?
   </li>
   <li>
    All cells, including both plant and animal cells, need energy for processes such as active transport. How do cells obtain the energy they need?
