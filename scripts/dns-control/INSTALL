The frontend directory has the web interface in it.

Web setup:
1) Create a mysql database
2) Create a mysql user
3) import the dump: mysql dns < frontend/sql/dump.sql
4) Create Admin, Run this sql query
        INSERT INTO `admins` ( `userid` , `username` , `password` ) VALUES ( '', 'ADMIN_USERNAME', MD5( 'YOUR_PASSWORD' ));

5) edit frontend/includes/config.inc.php
6) chmod 777 frontend/compiled_templates
Admin Login URL /admin/


Backend Setup:
1) Place scrips in a directory outside the web interface.
2) edit backend/includes/globals.php
3) change this line to the correct path
4) require("/var/www/html/includes/config.inc.php");
5) chmod 755 *.php
6) ensure path to php is correct in all command scripts
7) Setup processqueue.php to run  on a cron as often as 1 minute.
    */5 * * * * /path/to/processqueue.php
