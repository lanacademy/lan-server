    What do you see when you look at this picture? Is it just a mass of tangled ribbons? Look closely. It&#8217;s actually a complex pattern of three-dimensional shapes. It represents the structure of a common chemical found inside living cells. The chemical is a protein called hemoglobin. It is the protein in red blood cells which transports oxygen around the body. What are proteins? What other chemicals are found in living things? You will learn the answers to these questions as you read about the chemistry of life.

   If you look at your hand, what do you see? Of course, you see skin, which consists of cells. But what are skin cells made of? Like all living cells, they are made of matter. In fact, all things are made of matter.
   <strong>
    Matter
   </strong>
   is anything that takes up space and has mass. Matter, in turn, is made up of chemical substances. In this lesson you will learn about the chemical substances that make up living things.

   A chemical substance is matter that has a definite composition. It also has the same composition throughout. A chemical substance may be either an element or a compound.

   The Significance of Carbon

   A compound found mainly in living things is known as an
   <strong>
    organic compound
   </strong>
   . Organic compounds make up the cells and other structures of organisms and carry out life processes. Carbon is the main element in organic compounds, so carbon is essential to life on Earth. Without carbon, life as we know it could not exist. Why is carbon so basic to life? The reason is carbon&#8217;s ability to form stable bonds with many elements, including itself. This property allows carbon to form a huge variety of very large and complex molecules. In fact, there are nearly 10 million carbon-based compounds in living things! However, the millions of organic compounds can be grouped into just four major types: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. You can compare the four types in

   </strong>
   is an organic compound made up of small molecules called
   <strong>
    amino acids
   </strong>
   . There are 20 different amino acids commonly found in the proteins of living things. Small proteins may contain just a few hundred amino acids, whereas large proteins may contain thousands of amino acids.

   When amino acids bind together, they form a long chain called a
   <strong>
    polypeptide
   </strong>
   . A protein consists of one or more polypeptide chains. A protein may have up to four levels of structure. The lowest level, a protein&#8217;s primary structure, is its sequence of amino acids. Higher levels of protein structure are described in

   Proteins play many important roles in living things. Some proteins help cells keep their shape, and some make up muscle tissues. Many proteins speed up chemical reactions in cells. Other proteins are antibodies, which bind to foreign substances such as bacteria and target them for destruction. Still other proteins carry messages or materials. For example, human red blood cells contain a protein called hemoglobin, which binds with oxygen. Hemoglobin allows the blood to carry oxygen from the lungs to cells throughout the body. A model of the hemoglobin molecule is shown in

   , you will see that the sugar of one nucleotide binds to the phosphate group of the next nucleotide. These two molecules alternate to form the backbone of the nucleotide chain. The nitrogen bases in a nucleic acid stick out from the backbone. There are four different types of bases: cytosine, adenine, guanine, and either thymine (in DNA) or uracil (in RNA). In DNA, bonds form between bases on the two nucleotide chains and hold the chains together. Each type of base binds with just one other type of base: cytosine always binds with guanine, and adenine always binds with thymine. These pairs of bases are called
   <strong>
    complementary base pairs

   Conservation of Matter
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-YjkxMTZiNDNiN2I2ZTI3NTIxN2U3ZjdhMDU1YWRiMjE.-ijq">
   In a chemical reaction, the quantity of each element does not change; there is the same amount of each element in the products as there was in the reactants. This is because matter is always conserved. The conservation of matter is reflected in a reaction&#8217;s chemical equation. The same number of atoms of each element appears on each side of the arrow. For example, in the chemical equation above, there are four hydrogen atoms on each side of the arrow. Can you find all four of them on each side of this equation?

   Why do all chemical reactions need energy to get started? In order for reactions to begin, reactant molecules must bump into each other, so they must be moving, and movement requires energy. When reactant molecules bump together, they may repel each other because of intermolecular forces pushing them apart. Overcoming these forces so the molecules can come together and react also takes energy.

   Enzymes are involved in most biochemical reactions, and they do their job extremely well. A typical biochemical reaction could take several days to occur without an enzyme. With the proper enzyme, the same reaction can occur in just a split second! Without enzymes to speed up biochemical reactions, most organisms could not survive.

   Hydrogen bonds cause water to have a relatively high boiling point of 100&#176;C (212&#176;F). Because of its high boiling point, most water on Earth is in a liquid state rather than in a gaseous state. Water in its liquid state is needed by all living things. Hydrogen bonds also cause water to expand when it freezes. This, in turn, causes ice to have a lower density (mass/volume) than liquid water. The lower density of ice means that it floats on water. For example, in cold climates, ice floats on top of the water in lakes. This allows lake animals such as fish to survive the winter by staying in the water under the ice.

   is a mixture of two or more substances that has the same composition throughout. Some solutions are acids and some are bases. To understand acids and bases, you need to know more about pure water. In pure water (such as distilled water), a tiny fraction of water molecules naturally breaks down to form ions. An ion is an electrically charged atom or molecule. The breakdown of water is represented by the chemical equation

   The concentration of hydronium ions in a solution is known as acidity. In pure water, the concentration of hydronium ions is very low; only about 1 in 10 million water molecules naturally breaks down to form a hydronium ion. As a result, pure water is essentially neutral. Acidity is measured on a scale called

Strong acids can also damage materials, even hard materials such as glass.

   Acids and Bases in Organisms
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-MWUxMDY0ZDliZmQwMDFiMTUzNGJmMWRlZDAyYjdiZmY.-l4c">
   Acids and bases are important in living things because most enzymes can do their job only at a certain level of acidity. Cells secrete acids and bases to maintain the proper pH for enzymes to work. For example, every time you digest food, acids and bases are at work in your digestive system. Consider the enzyme pepsin, which helps break down proteins in the stomach. Pepsin needs an acidic environment to do its job, and the stomach secretes a strong acid that allows pepsin to work. However, when stomach contents enter the small intestine, the acid must be neutralized. This is because enzymes in the small intestine need a basic environment in order to work. An organ called the pancreas secretes a strong base into the small intestine, and this base neutralizes the acid.

   Lesson Summary
  </h2>
  <ul id="x-ck12-ZTIzMmZkMWIzNGM1NTg1NmY3NWU2ODAyNjZkMDY2MDY.-pqs">
   <li>
    Most of Earth&#8217;s water is salt water in the oceans. Less than 3% is freshwater.
   </li>
   <li>
    Water molecules are polar, so they form hydrogen bonds. This gives water unique properties, such as a relatively high boiling point.
   </li>
   <li>
    The extremely low hydronium ion concentration of pure water gives pure water a neutral pH of 7. Acids have a pH lower than 7, and bases have a pH higher than 7.

   <li>
    Water is involved in most biochemical reactions. Therefore, water is essential to life.
