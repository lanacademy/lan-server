    Cell division is just one of the stages that all cells go through during their life. This includes cells that are harmful, such as cancer cells. Cancer cells divide more often than normal cells, and grow out of control. In fact, this is how cancer cells cause illness. In this chapter, you will read about how cells divide, what other stages cells go through, and what causes cancer cells to divide out of control and harm the body.

   Introduction

  <p id="x-ck12-NDMyMDQ4Njk2MDU2NzExNzdmYjFkOGYzMDJkNTg1ZDc.-whf">
   You consist of a great many cells, but like all other organisms, you started life as a single cell. How did you develop from a single cell into an organism with trillions of cells? The answer is cell division. After cells grow to their maximum size, they divide into two new cells. These new cells are small at first, but they grow quickly and eventually divide and produce more new cells. This process keeps repeating in a continuous cycle.

   <strong>
    Cell division
   </strong>
   is the process in which one cell, called the parent cell, divides to form two new cells, referred to as daughter cells. How this happens depends on whether the cell is prokaryotic or eukaryotic.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-OTY5ZjIyNzE1MmIwNGJhNzk4ODU4NTA5YjgwZTRiYzc.-rju">
   Cell division is simpler in prokaryotes than eukaryotes because prokaryotic cells themselves are simpler. Prokaryotic cells have a single circular chromosome, no nucleus, and few other organelles. Eukaryotic cells, in contrast, have multiple chromosomes contained within a nucleus and many other organelles. All of these cell parts must be duplicated and then separated when the cell divides.

    Binary Fission in a Bacterial Cell. Cell division is relatively simple in prokaryotic cells. The two cells are dividing by binary fission. Green and orange lines indicate old and newly-generated bacterial cell walls, respectively. Eventually the parent cell will pinch apart to form two identical daughter cells. Left, growth at the center of bacterial body. Right, apical growth from the ends of the bacterial body.

   <li>
    Step 1:
    <strong>
     DNA Replication
    </strong>
    . Just before the cell divides, its DNA is copied in a process called DNA replication. This results in two identical chromosomes instead of just one. This step is necessary so that when the cell divides, each daughter cell will have its own chromosome.
   </li>
   <li>
    Step 2: Chromosome Segregation. The two chromosomes segregate, or separate, and move to opposite ends (known as &#8220;poles&#8221;) of the cell. This occurs as each copy of DNA attaches to different parts of the cell membrane.
   </li>
   <li>
    Step 3: Separation. A new plasma membrane starts growing into the center of the cell, and the cytoplasm splits apart, forming two daughter cells. As the cell begins to pull apart, the new and the original chromosomes are separated. The two daughter cells that result are genetically identical to each other and to the parent cell. New cell wall must also form around the two cells.

  <p id="x-ck12-ZjM2MzJlMmFiOThjYjkxYjAyYmM0NWY1ODM0Mzc3ODI.-spn">
   Cell division is more complex in eukaryotes than prokaryotes. Prior to dividing, all the DNA in a eukaryotic cell&#8217;s multiple chromosomes is replicated. Its organelles are also duplicated. Then, when the cell divides, it occurs in two major steps:
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-NzdlNzgyOTY1YzdlZDQ0OGI4MzBhOWI3MTAzYWUwNjI.-kyc">
   <li>
    The first step is
    <strong>
     mitosis
    </strong>
    , a multi-phase process in which the nucleus of the cell divides. During mitosis, the nuclear membrane breaks down and later reforms. The chromosomes are also sorted and separated to ensure that each daughter cell receives a complete set of chromosomes. Mitosis is described in greater detail in the lesson &#8220;Chromosomes and Mitosis.&#8221;
   </li>
   <li>
    The second major step is cytokinesis. As in prokaryotic cells, during this step the cytoplasm divides and two daughter cells form.
   </li>

   <strong>
    cell cycle
   </strong>
   is a repeating series of events that include growth, DNA synthesis, and cell division. The cell cycle in prokaryotes is quite simple: the cell grows, its DNA replicates, and the cell divides. In eukaryotes, the cell cycle is more complicated.

   If the cell cycle occurred without regulation, cells might go from one phase to the next before they were ready. What controls the cell cycle? How does the cell know when to grow, synthesize DNA, and divide? The cell cycle is controlled mainly by regulatory proteins.

Regulatory proteins control the cell cycle at key checkpoints, which are shown in

   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-NmM3YjEyNTRkOTQ1ZGI5MmZkYzA0NTNlNDcyOTg4Zjk.-yfb">
   In eukaryotic cells, the nucleus divides before the cell itself divides. The process in which the nucleus divides is called mitosis. Before mitosis occurs, a cell&#8217;s DNA is replicated. This is necessary so that each daughter cell will have a complete copy of the genetic material from the parent cell. How is the replicated DNA sorted and separated so that each daughter cell gets a complete set of the genetic material? To understand how this happens, you need to know more chromosomes.

    Chromosomes

   are coiled structures made of DNA and proteins. Chromosomes are the form of the genetic material of a cell during cell division. During other phases of the cell cycle, DNA is not coiled into chromosomes. Instead, it exists as a grainy material called

    chromatin

Each chromosome in one set is matched by a chromosome of the same type in the other set, so there are actually 23 pairs of chromosomes per cell. Each pair consists of chromosomes of the same size and shape that also contain the same genes. The chromosomes in a pair are known as

   Introduction

   Cell division is how organisms grow and repair themselves. It is also how they produce offspring. Many single-celled organisms reproduce by binary fission. The parent cell simply divides to form two daughter cells that are identical to the parent. In many other organisms, two parents are involved, and the offspring are not identical to the parents. In fact, each offspring is unique. Look at the family in

   Reproduction: Asexual vs. Sexual

  <p id="x-ck12-ZGQ5ZTQzMDNmNTA1OGZiNWVhN2U5NzgzMDI3YWJlZTE.-cqk">
   Reproduction is the process by which organisms give rise to offspring. It is one of the defining characteristics of living things. There are two basic types of reproduction: asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.

   <strong>
    Asexual reproduction
   </strong>
   involves a single parent. It results in offspring that are genetically identical to each other and to the parent. All prokaryotes and some eukaryotes reproduce this way. There are several different methods of asexual reproduction. They include binary fission, fragmentation, and budding.

    Binary fission occurs when a parent cell splits into two identical daughter cells of the same size. This process was described in detail in the lesson &#8220;Cell Division and the Cell Cycle.&#8221;

    Fragmentation occurs when a parent organism breaks into fragments, or pieces, and each fragment develops into a new organism. Starfish, like the one in

   Asexual reproduction can be very rapid. This is an advantage for many organisms. It allows them to crowd out other organisms that reproduce more slowly. Bacteria, for example, may divide several times per hour. Under ideal conditions, 100 bacteria can divide to produce millions of bacterial cells in just a few hours! However, most bacteria do not live under ideal conditions. If they did, the entire surface of the planet would soon be covered with them. Instead, their reproduction is kept in check by limited resources, predators, and their own wastes. This is true of most other organisms as well.

   cells. This means they contain only half the number of chromosomes found in other cells of the organism. Gametes are produced by a type of cell division called meiosis, which is described in detail below. The process in which two gametes unite is called

Two cell divisions occur during meiosis, and a total of four haploid cells are produced. The two cell divisions are called meiosis I and meiosis II. The overall process of meiosis is summarized in

   Sexual Reproduction and Genetic Variation
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-YjdiNTIzZjhiZjZhOGRhMmFlYjIwMWM2YTgwMDE4ZDY.-16q">
   Sexual reproduction results in offspring that are genetically unique. They differ from both parents and also from each other. This occurs for a number of reasons.
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-OTg3NWJhNDA2ZTQyMjVmMTljMTQxM2RmNTc0OWY4NTU.-zft">
   <li>
    When homologous chromosomes pair up during meiosis I, crossing-over can occur.
    <strong>
     Crossing-over
    </strong>
    is the exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes. It results in new combinations of genes on each chromosome.
   </li>
   <li>
    When cells divide during meiosis, homologous chromosomes are randomly distributed to daughter cells, and different chromosomes segregate independently of each other. This called is called
    <strong>
     independent assortment
    </strong>
    . It results in gametes that have unique combinations of chromosomes.
   </li>
   <li>
    In sexual reproduction, two gametes unite to produce an offspring. But which two of the millions of possible gametes will it be? This is likely to be a matter of chance. It is obviously another source of genetic variation in offspring.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZmU0YTVmN2M0ODBkYTA3MWMxMDc5MmFhZWQ2ODYyNzA.-cne">
   All of these mechanisms working together result in an amazing amount of potential variation. Each human couple, for example, has the potential to produce more than 64 trillion genetically unique children. No wonder we are all different!

   Sexual Reproduction and Life Cycles
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-YzdjNjFkZDQyMDQ3ZWQxNjgwMTQxZDQ0OTM3NjkyNjM.-5ra">
   Sexual reproduction occurs in a cycle. Diploid parents produce haploid gametes that unite and develop into diploid adults, which repeat the cycle. This series of life stages and events that a sexually reproducing organism goes through is called its
   <strong>
    life cycle
   </strong>
   . Sexually reproducing organisms can have different types of life cycles. Three are described in the following sections.

   ) is the simplest life cycle. It is found in many single-celled organisms. Organisms with a haploid life cycle spend the majority of their lives as haploid gametes. When the haploid gametes fuse, they form a diploid zygote. It quickly undergoes meiosis to produce more haploid gametes that repeat the life cycle.

   Lesson Summary
  </h2>
  <ul id="x-ck12-YWZiZmFjNjcwOWQyNmNkYzQzYWM1NDQyYzY5Njc2Y2E.-cke">
   <li>
    Asexual reproduction involves one parent and produces offspring that are genetically identical to each other and to the parent. Sexual reproduction involves two parents and produces offspring that are genetically unique.
   </li>
   <li>
    During sexual reproduction, two haploid gametes join in the process of fertilization to produce a diploid zygote. Meiosis is the type of cell division that produces gametes. It involves two cell divisions and produces four haploid cells.
   </li>
   <li>
    Sexual reproduction has the potential to produce tremendous genetic variation in offspring. This variation is due to independent assortment and crossing-over during meiosis and random union of gametes during fertilization.
   </li>
   <li>
    A life cycle is the sequence of stages an organisms goes through from one generation to the next. Organisms that reproduce sexually can have different types of life cycles, such as haploid or diploid life cycles.

   Points to Consider
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-NDQ0NDBiZDk2ODdmMzU3ZmFkNDM4NzA0YzQ3ZWRlNzk.-eir">
   In sexually reproducing organisms, parents pass a copy of each type of chromosome to their offspring by producing gametes. When gametes are fertilized and form offspring, each has a unique combination of chromosomes and genes from both parents. The inherited gene combination determines the characteristics of the offspring.
