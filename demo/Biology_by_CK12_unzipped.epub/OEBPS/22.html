   Introduction

   A small child darts in front of your bike as you race down the street. You see the child and immediately react. You put on the brakes, steer away from the child, and yell out a warning&#8212;all in just a split second. How do you respond so quickly? Such rapid responses are controlled by your nervous system. The
   <strong>
    nervous system
   </strong>
   is a complex network of nervous tissue that carries electrical messages throughout the body (see

   Although the nervous system is very complex, nervous tissue consists of just two basic types of nerve cells: neurons and glial cells.
   <strong>
    Neurons
   </strong>
   are the structural and functional units of the nervous system. They transmit electrical signals, called
   <strong>
    nerve impulses.
   </strong>
   Glial cells provide support for neurons. For example, they provide neurons with nutrients and other materials.

   ). Myelin is a lipid produced by a type of a glial cell known as a Schwann cell. The myelin sheath acts like a layer of insulation, similar to the plastic that encases an electrical cord. Regularly spaced nodes, or gaps, in the myelin sheath allow nerve impulses to skip along the axon very rapidly.

   When a neuron is not actively transmitting a nerve impulse, it is in a resting state, ready to transmit a nerve impulse. During the resting state, the sodium-potassium pump maintains a difference in charge across the cell membrane (see

   <sup>
    +
   </sup>
   ) out of the cell and potassium ions (K
   <sup>
    +
   </sup>
   ) into the cell. As a result, the inside of the neuron is negatively charged, compared to the extracellular fluid surrounding the neuron. This is due to many more positivly charged ions outside the cell compared to inside the cell This difference in electrical charge is called the
   <strong>
    resting potential.

   Action Potential
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MGUwZjgxNWRkMDM4OWFiMDQ3ZTQ1MTU1ZTc4YWJiNzI.-1lr">
   A nerve impulse is a sudden reversal of the electrical charge across the membrane of a resting neuron. The reversal of charge is called an
   <strong>
    action potential.
   </strong>
   It begins when the neuron receives a chemical signal from another cell. The signal causes gates in sodium ion channels to open, allowing positive sodium ions to flow back into the cell. As a result, the inside of the cell becomes positively charged compared to the outside of the cell. This reversal of charge ripples down the axon very rapidly as an electric current (see

   The place where an axon terminal meets another cell is called a
   <strong>
    synapse

   <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTIyLTA2LVN5bmFwc2U.">

   ). When an action potential reaches the axon terminal, the axon terminal releases molecules of a chemical called a
   <strong>
    neurotransmitter
   </strong>
   . The neurotransmitter molecules travel across the synaptic cleft and bind to receptors on the membrane of the other cell. If the other cell is a neuron, this starts an action potential in the other cell. You can view animations of neurotransmission at a synapse at the following links:

The somatic nervous system also controls some unconscious movements called reflexes. A reflex is a very rapid motor response that is not directed by the brain. In a reflex, nerve impulses travel to and from the spinal cord in a reflex arc, like the one in

Sensory receptors send nerve impulses to sensory nerves, which carry the nerve impulses to the central nervous system. The brain then interprets the nerve impulses to form a response.

The retina contains light receptor cells, like those in the photograph on the first page of this chapter. These cells send nerve impulses to the optic nerve, which carries the impulses to the brain. The brain interprets the impulses and &#8220;tells&#8221; us what we are seeing. To learn more about the eye and the sense of sight, you can go to the link below.

The liquid moves in response to the vibrations, causing tiny hair cells lining the cochlea to bend. In response, the hair cells send nerve impulses to the auditory nerve, which carries the impulses to the brain. The brain interprets the impulses and &#8220;tells&#8221; us what we are hearing.

This occurs because the sense of smell contributes to the sense of taste, and a stuffy nose interferes with the ability to smell.

   Psychoactive drugs may bring about changes in mood that users find desirable, so the drugs may be abused.
   <strong>
    Drug abuse
   </strong>
   is use of a drug without the advice of a medical professional and for reasons not originally intended. Continued use of a psychoactive drug may lead to
   <strong>
    drug addiction

  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-OTQwM2RkYTU3YjhhNjE2MTg5M2JlOWI2NDM1NGYyMzQ.-sey">
   <li>
    Vascular disorders involve problems with blood flow. For example, a stroke occurs when a blood clot blocks blood flow to part of the brain. Brain cells die quickly if their oxygen supply is cut off. This may cause paralysis and loss of other normal functions, depending on the part of the brain that is damaged.
   </li>
   <li>
    Nervous tissue may become infected by microorganisms. Meningitis, for example, is caused by a viral or bacterial infection of the tissues covering the brain. This may cause the brain to swell and lead to brain damage and death.
   </li>
   <li>
    Brain or spinal cord injuries may cause paralysis and other disabilities. Injuries to peripheral nerves can cause localized pain or numbness.
   </li>
   <li>
    Abnormal brain functions can occur for a variety of reasons. Examples include headaches, such as migraine headaches, and epilepsy, in which seizures occur.
   </li>
   <li>
    Nervous tissue may degenerate, or break down. Alzheimer&#8217;s disease is an example of this type of disorder, as is Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. ALS is also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. It leads to a gradual loss of higher brain functions. For a detailed video discussion of Alzheimer's disease see the the visualMD.com at

   Autism is a developmental disorder that appears in the first three years of life, and affects the brain's normal development of social and communication skills. Autism is a broad term given to a spectrum of disorders known as the autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). There are three types of ASDs: autistic disorder (also called &#8220;classic&#8221; autism), Asperger syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder &#8211; not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS; also called &#8220;atypical autism&#8221;).
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZDA1YTQ5NGJjNmEwYzY3NGE5OTQ0YzM4MmZiNjk3Nzk.-29y">
   Individuals with autistic disorder usually have significant language delays, social and communication challenges, and "unusual" behaviors and interests. Many people with autistic disorder also have intellectual disability. People with Asperger syndrome usually have some milder symptoms of autistic disorder. They might have social challenges and "unusual" behaviors and interests. However, they typically do not have problems with language or intellectual disability. People who meet some of the criteria for autistic disorder or Asperger syndrome, but not all, may be diagnosed with PDD-NOS. People with PDD-NOS usually have fewer and milder symptoms than those with autistic disorder. The symptoms might cause only social and communication challenges.

   Lesson Summary
  </h2>
  <ul id="x-ck12-MjcwMjIwYmU4ODI0ZjdmYWMzYTRjOTI4YmQ2NjAxNjc.-zkm">
   <li>
    Neurons are the structural and functional units of the nervous system. They consist of a cell body, dendrites, and axon. Neurons transmit nerve impulses to other cells. Types of neurons include sensory neurons, motor neurons, and interneurons.
   </li>
   <li>
    A nerve impulse begins when a neuron receives a chemical stimulus. The impulse travels down the axon membrane as an electrical action potential to the axon terminal. The axon terminal releases neurotransmitters that carry the nerve impulse to the next cell.
   </li>
   <li>
    The central nervous includes the brain and spinal cord. The brain is the control center of the nervous system. It controls virtually all mental and physical processes. The spinal cord is a long, thin bundle of nervous tissue that passes messages from the body to the brain and from the brain to the body.
   </li>
   <li>
    The peripheral nervous system consists of all the nervous tissue that lies outside the central nervous system. It is connected to the central nervous system by nerves. It has several divisions and subdivisions that transmit nerve impulses between the central nervous system and the rest of the body.
   </li>
   <li>
    Human senses include sight, hearing, balance, taste, smell, and touch. Sensory organs such as the eyes contain cells called sensory receptors that respond to particular sensory stimuli. Sensory nerves carry nerve impulses from sensory receptors to the central nervous system. The brain interprets the nerve impulses to form a response.
   </li>
   <li>
    Drugs are chemicals that affect the body&#8217;s structure or function. Psychoactive drugs, such as caffeine and alcohol, affect the central nervous system by influencing the transmission of nerve impulses in the brain. Psychoactive drugs may be abused and lead to drug addiction.
   </li>
   <li>
    Disorders of the nervous system include blood flow problems such as stroke, infections such as meningitis, brain injuries, and degeneration of nervous tissue, as in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.

Hormones act slowly compared with the rapid transmission of electrical messages by the nervous system. They must travel through the bloodstream to the cells they affect, and this takes time. On the other hand, because endocrine hormones are released into the bloodstream, they travel throughout the body. As a result, endocrine hormones can affect many cells and have body-wide effects.

   <li>
    The two
    <strong>
     parathyroid glands
    </strong>
    are located behind the thyroid gland. Parathyroid hormone helps keep the level of calcium in the blood within a narrow range. It stimulates bone cells to dissolve calcium in bone matrix and release it into the blood.

   <li>
    The
    <strong>
     pineal gland
    </strong>
    is a tiny gland located at the base of the brain. It secretes the hormone melatonin. This hormone controls sleep-wake cycles and several other processes.
   </li>
   <li>
    The
    <strong>
     pancreas
    </strong>
    is located near the stomach. Its hormones include insulin and glucagon. These two hormones work together to control the level of glucose in the blood. Insulin causes excess blood glucose to be taken up by the liver, which stores the glucose as glycogen. Glucagon stimulates the liver to break down glycogen into glucose and release it back into the blood. The pancreas also secretes digestive enzymes into the digestive tract.

    The two
    <strong>
     adrenal glands

    are located above the kidneys. Each gland has an inner and outer part. The outer part, called the cortex, secretes hormones such as cortisol, which helps the body deal with stress, and aldosterone, which helps regulate the balance of minerals in the body. The inner part of each adrenal gland, called the medulla, secretes fight-or-flight hormones such as adrenaline, which prepare the body to respond to emergencies. For example, adrenaline increases the amount of oxygen and glucose going to the muscles. You can see an animation of this response at

   How Hormones Work
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-MTM5N2ZjYmMyNzZlNTVhNzg1ZDk5YTA4NmYwZjA3NTA.-oft">
   Endocrine hormones travel throughout the body in the blood. However, each hormone affects only certain cells, called target cells. A
   <strong>
    target cell
   </strong>
   is the type of cell on which a hormone has an effect. A target cell is affected by a particular hormone because it has receptor proteins that are specific to that hormone. A hormone travels through the bloodstream until it finds a target cell with a matching receptor it can bind to. When the hormone binds to a receptor, it causes a change within the cell. Exactly how this works depends on whether the hormone is a steroid hormone or a non-steroid hormone. At the link below, you can watch an animation that shows how both types of hormones work.

   Hormone Regulation: Feedback Mechanisms

   Hormones control many cell activities, so they are very important for homeostasis. But what controls the hormones themselves? Most hormones are regulated by feedback mechanisms. A feedback mechanism is a loop in which a product feeds back to control its own production. Most hormone feedback mechanisms involve negative feedback loops. Negative feedback keeps the concentration of a hormone within a narrow range.

   Here&#8217;s how thyroid regulation works. The hypothalamus secretes thyrotropin-releasing hormone, or TRH. TRH stimulates the pituitary gland to produce thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH. TSH, in turn, stimulates the thyroid gland to secrete its hormones. When the level of thyroid hormones is high enough, the hormones feedback to stop the hypothalamus from secreting TRH and the pituitary from secreting TSH. Without the stimulation of TSH, the thyroid gland stops secreting its hormones. Soon, the level of thyroid hormone starts to fall too low. What do you think happens next? This process is discussed at

   Positive feedback occurs when a product feeds back to increase its own production. This causes conditions to become increasingly extreme. An example of positive feedback is milk production by a mother for her baby. As the baby suckles, nerve messages from the nipple cause the pituitary gland to secrete prolactin. Prolactin, in turn, stimulates the mammary glands to produce milk, so the baby suckles more. This causes more prolactin to be secreted and more milk to be produced. This example is one of the few positive feedback mechanisms in the human body. What do you think would happen if milk production by the mammary glands was controlled by negative feedback instead?

   Hormone Resistance
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NTM0YTEwMzJmOTVlNWQ1YzBkNTQwMDc5MmYwZTU0ZmQ.-ird">
   In some cases, an endocrine gland secretes a normal amount of hormone, but target cells do not respond to the hormone. Often, this is because target cells have because resistant to the hormone. Type 2 diabetes is an example of this type of endocrine disorder. In Type 2 diabetes, body cells do not respond to normal amounts of insulin. As a result, cells do not take up glucose and the amount of glucose in the blood becomes too high. This type of diabetes is not generally treated with insulin injections. Instead, it is usually treated with medication and diet.

   Lesson Summary
  </h2>
  <ul id="x-ck12-NjFjMGMxMTBiOWNjOWQzNjAwZjk2MTljYzA0OWQxY2Y.-s8e">
   <li>
    The endocrine system consists of glands that secrete hormones into the bloodstream. It is regulated by a part of the brain called the hypothalamus, which also secretes hormones. The hypothalamus controls the pituitary gland, which is called the &#8220;master gland&#8221; of the endocrine system because its hormones regulate other endocrine glands. Other endocrine glands include the thyroid gland and pancreas.
   </li>
   <li>
    Hormones work by binding to protein receptors either inside target cells or on their plasma membranes. The binding of a steroid hormone forms a hormone-receptor complex that affects gene expression in the nucleus of the target cell. The binding of a non-steroid hormone activates a second messenger that affects processes within the target cell.
   </li>
   <li>
    Most hormones are controlled by negative feedback in which the hormone feeds back to decrease its own production. This type of feedback brings things back to normal whenever they start to become too extreme. Positive feedback is much less common because it causes conditions to become increasingly extreme.
   </li>
   <li>
    Endocrine system disorders usually involve the secretion of too much or not enough hormone. For example, a tumor of the adrenal gland may lead to excessive secretion of growth hormone, which causes gigantism. In Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not secrete enough insulin, which causes high levels of glucose in the blood.
   </li>

  </p>
  <h3 id="x-ck12-QXBwbHkgQ29uY2VwdHM._1-bht">
   Apply Concepts
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NDBkZjg4OTczNzc1MTkxOWE2MjhiZTAyOGM3M2FlYTI.-yfx">
   5. Tasha had a thyroid test. Her doctor gave her an injection of TSH and 15 minutes later measured the level of thyroid hormone in her blood. What is TSH? Why do you think Tasha&#8217;s doctor gave her an injection of TSH? How would this affect the level of thyroid hormone in her blood if her thyroid is normal?
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-YjZiYTQxZDI4ZGMwYmQ3Y2IyNGJiYTMyZWJmNTUyNDk.-o5j">
   6. After the thyroid test, Tasha&#8217;s doctor said she has an underactive thyroid. What symptoms would you expect Tasha to have? Why?
  </p>
  <h3 id="x-ck12-VGhpbmsgQ3JpdGljYWxseQ.._1-fou">
   Think Critically
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MmZjZWMwMTdlMDFjNmVmZDdhY2Q3ZGUwYmFiZDcxNzI.-bkq">
   7. Explain how the nervous system is linked with the endocrine system.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-OGI4MDg0MDhiMTFhNWY2NjA1MTcwMWFhMDRmYjhlNjY.-mfp">
   8. Compare and contrast how steroid and non-steroid hormones affect target cells.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZTVmYjg0Y2U4ODI1MGEzZWMxZGQ3MWEyMzI0OTJjNmI.-cnu">
   9. Why are negative feedback mechanisms more common than positive feedback mechanisms in the human body? What might happen if an endocrine hormone such as thyroid hormone was controlled by positive instead of negative feedback?
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-NWJkMzhkZGJjZGY2MGU1MDU4YzljZjI3YWMwZDY2YzY.-pxt">
   10. Explain why a person with type 2 diabetes cannot be helped by insulin injections.

   Points to Consider
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-MWU4YzM2MGI3NjFiMzc0NzIxYzUzMWE4ZDBhZjliOTM.-rbq">
   In this lesson you learned that endocrine hormones can affect cells throughout the body because they travel in the blood through the circulatory system.
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-NmIyM2U5NGEyMzU3ZDRmYzVjNGUxNmY0Y2IyODkwMmI.-qs6">
   <li>
    Do you know what organs make up the circulatory system?
   </li>
   <li>
    Can you explain what causes blood to move through the system?
