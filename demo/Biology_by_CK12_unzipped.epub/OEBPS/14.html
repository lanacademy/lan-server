    This organism consists of a single cell with several flagella. Is it a prokaryote, such as a bacterium? Actually, it&#8217;s larger than a prokaryotic cell, and it also has a nucleus. Therefore, this organism belongs to the domain Eukarya, the domain that includes humans. This particular eukaryote is one of the smallest, simplest organisms in the domain, called a protist. It&#8217;s scientific name is

   Scientists think that protists are the oldest eukaryotes. If so, they must have evolved from prokaryotic cells. How did this happen? The endosymbiotic theory provides the most widely-accepted explanation. That&#8217;s because it is well supported by evidence.

   The First Eukaryotic Cells
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-N2MwZjliOTQ5ZDRkYjM3ZjRkMjk3YTA0ZTU2ZTljNDU.-sqt">
   According to the endosymbiotic theory, the first eukaryotic cells evolved from a symbiotic relationship between two or more prokaryotic cells. Smaller prokaryotic cells were engulfed by (or invaded) larger prokaryotic cells. The small cells (now called endosymbionts) benefited from the relationship by getting a safe home and nutrients. The large cells (now called hosts) benefited by getting some of the organic molecules or energy released by the endosymbionts. Eventually, the endosymbionts evolved into organelles of the host cells. After that, neither could live without the other.

   , some of the endosymbionts were aerobic bacteria. They were specialized to break down chemicals and release energy. They evolved into the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells. Some of the small cells were cyanobacteria. They were specialized for photosynthesis. They evolved into the chloroplasts of eukaryotic cells.

   Many pieces of evidence support the endosymbiotic theory. For example:

   <li>
    Mitochondria and chloroplasts are surrounded by their own plasma membranes, which are similar to bacterial membranes.

    New mitochondria and chloroplasts are produced through a process similar to binary fission. Bacteria also reproduce through binary fission.

   Characteristics of Protists
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-MDQxYmRjNzMxZGFlMjM2NTE0ZjI2NDA5OTgzMTRlMjk.-i9r">
   Like all other eukaryotes, protists have a nucleus containing their DNA. They also have other membrane-bound organelles, such as mitochondria. Most protists are single-celled. Some are multicellular. Because the protist kingdom is so diverse, their ways of getting food and reproducing vary widely.

   Protist Habitats
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MjcxZDFjMTNiMDdiNDhiNDQ4YTZkOTgxOGNjMzdiNzE.-2qz">
   Most protists are aquatic organisms. They need a moist environment to survive. They are found mainly in damp soil, marshes, puddles, lakes, and the ocean. Some protists are free-living organisms. Others are involved in symbiotic relationships. They live in or on other organisms, including humans.

   . It usually exists as haploid cells that reproduce by binary fission. In a stressful environment, such as one that is very dry,
   <em>
    Spirogyra
   </em>
   may produce tough spores that can withstand harsh conditions. Spores are reproductive cells produced by protists (and other organisms). If two protist spores are close together, they can fuse to form a diploid zygote. This is a type of sexual reproduction. The zygote then undergoes meiosis, producing haploid cells that repeat the cycle.

   Ecology of Protozoa
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-N2I3OWQxMDRkNjkzZmFjMTJiMjAxZWRmYTc1NDExNjA.-nwu">
   Protozoa generally feed by engulfing and digesting other organisms. As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations in check. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. For their part, protozoa are important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms.

   Why are algae considered plant-like? The main reason is that they contain chloroplasts and produce food through photosynthesis. However, they lack many other structures of true plants. For example, algae do not have roots, stems, or leaves. Some algae also differ from plants in being motile. They may move with pseudopods or flagella. Although not plants themselves, algae were probably the ancestors of plants.

Their chloroplasts have two membranes because the cell membranes of the cyanobacteria became additional plasma membranes of the chloroplasts. Scientists think that euglenids and dinoflagellates evolved later, from endosymbiotic relationships with green and red algae. This is why their chloroplasts have three membranes. Differences in the types of chlorophyll in the four types of algae also support the hypothesized evolutionary relationships.

   ). Why go to so much trouble to reproduce? Asexual reproduction is fast, but it doesn&#8217;t create new genetic variation. Sexual reproduction is more complicated and risky, but it creates new gene combinations. Each strategy may work better under different conditions. Rapid population growth is adaptive when conditions are favorable. Genetic variation helps ensure that some organisms will survive if the environment changes.

   Fungus-Like Protists: Molds

   Fungus-like protists are molds. They are absorptive feeders on decaying organic matter. They resemble fungi, and they reproduce with spores as fungi do. However, in other ways, they are quite different from fungi and more like other protists. For example, they have cell walls made of cellulose, whereas fungi have cell walls made of chitin. Like other protists, they have complicated life cycles with both asexual and sexual reproduction. They are motile cells during some stages of their life cycle. Two major types of fungus-like protists are slime molds and water molds.

   Most fungi are multicellular, but some exist as single cells. Fungi spend most of their life cycle in the haploid state. They form diploid cells only during sexual reproduction. Like the cells of protists and plants, the cells of fungi have cell walls. But fungi are unique in having cell walls made of chitin instead of cellulose.
   <strong>
    Chitin
   </strong>
   is a tough carbohydrate that also makes up the exoskeleton (outer skeleton) of insects and related organisms.

   Reproduction of Fungi
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-OGYyYjhkZGFlOTAyY2IwZDQxMWU2MDI2YmQ2NzI5NjU.-nxv">
   The majority of fungi can reproduce both asexually and sexually. This allows them to adjust to conditions in the environment. They can spread quickly through asexual reproduction when conditions are stable. They can increase their genetic variation through sexual reproduction when conditions are changing and variation may help them survive.

   Asexual Reproduction
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZWQ4NWVmYzU5ZjEwMDJhYWY3ZGM5ODgwNWU5N2E5NWI.-9md">
   Almost all fungi reproduce asexually by producing spores. A fungi spore is a haploid cell produced by mitosis from a haploid parent cell. It is genetically identical to the parent cell. Fungi spores can develop into new haploid individuals without being fertilized.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-NmQ1YjhiNzdiMWJlYzIzNzE3MWM0MjJiOTllNWU1N2U.-1ah">
   Spores may be dispersed by moving water, wind, or other organisms. Some fungi even have &#8220;cannons&#8221; that &#8220;shoot&#8221; the spores far from the parent organism. This helps to ensure that the offspring will not have to compete with the parents for space or other resources. You are probably familiar with puffballs, like the one in

   Fungi lack chlorophyll, so they cannot make food by photosynthesis as plants can. Instead, they are heterotrophs, like animals. But they don&#8217;t have a mouth or teeth. So how do fungi &#8220;eat&#8221;? They get their nutrition by absorbing organic compounds from other organisms. The other organisms may be dead or alive, depending on the fungus.

Fungi use enzymes to digest organic remains and then absorb the resulting organic compounds. As decomposers, fungi are vital for the health of ecosystems. They break down nonliving organic matter and release the nutrients into the soil. Plants can then use the nutrients and pass them on to herbivores and other consumers.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-NGQwMDM0NzE2NjEyOTg0OTFlMjQ1Y2UwNTI4NzJlZDQ.-mkl">
   Bacteria are also major decomposers, but they can grow and feed only on the exposed surfaces of organic matter. In contrast, fungi can use their hyphae to penetrate deep into organic matter. Fungi are also the only decomposers that can break down tough plant substances, including lignin (in wood) and cellulose (in plant cell walls). They have special enzymes to do this work. The enzymes are released by the tips of the hyphae. Because of these abilities, fungi are the primary decomposers in forests (see

     mycorrhiza
    </strong>
    is a mutualistic relationship between a fungus and a plant. The fungus grows in or on the plant roots. The fungus benefits from the easy access to food made by the plant. The plant benefits because the fungus puts out mycelia that help absorb water and nutrients. Scientists think that a symbiotic relationship such as this may have allowed plants to first colonize the land.

    <strong>
     lichen

    is a mutualistic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic organism. The other organism is usually a cyanobacterium or green alga. The fungus grows around the bacterial or algal cells. The fungus benefits from the constant supply of food produced by the photosynthesizer. The photosynthesizer benefits from the water and nutrients absorbed by the fungus.

The protozoa attach to the lining of the host&#8217;s small intestine, where they prevent the host from fully absorbing nutrients. They may also cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever.

   Many fungi protect themselves from parasites and predators by producing toxic chemicals. If people eat toxic fungi, they may experience digestive problems, hallucinations, organ failure, and even death. Most cases of mushroom poisoning are due to mistaken identity. That&#8217;s because many toxic mushrooms look very similar to safe, edible mushrooms. An example is shown in

   Fungal Allergies
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZDljYmViZWVkYzYyODVkZTk0ZjFkMjgyOGYxMGMzZTA.-b1w">
   Mold allergies are very common. They are caused by airborne mold spores. When the spores enter the respiratory tract, the immune system responds to them as though they were harmful microbes. Symptoms may include sneezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing. The symptoms are likely to be more severe in people with asthma or other respiratory diseases. Long-term exposure to mold spores may also weaken the immune system.

  <p id="x-ck12-MTQ4M2UxOWQyY2JmMjNlYmRhZTlkZmM2NDc1M2M4ZTM.-fe1">
   Molds grow indoors as well as out. Indoors, they grow in showers, basements, and other damp places. Homes damaged in floods and hurricanes may have mold growing just about everywhere (see

  <ul id="x-ck12-ZWE2ZmE5OTM4NTllZThiNzM0NjhkZDk4OGEzMzIyYjU.-r7d">
   <li>
    Most protist diseases in humans are caused by protozoa. Protozoa make humans sick when they become human parasites.
    <em>
     Trypanosoma
    </em>
    protozoa cause Chagas disease and sleeping sickness.
    <em>
     Giardia
    </em>
    protozoa cause giardiasis, and
    <em>
     Plasmodium
    </em>
    protozoa cause malaria.
   </li>
   <li>
    Fungi cause three different types of human illness: poisonings, parasitic infections, and allergies. Many poisonous mushrooms are eaten by mistake because they look like edible mushrooms. Parasitic yeasts cause candidiasis, ringworm, and athlete&#8217;s foot. Mold allergies are very common.
