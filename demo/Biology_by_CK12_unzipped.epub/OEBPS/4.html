    This caterpillar is busily munching its way through leaf after leaf. In fact, caterpillars do little more than eat, day and night. Like all living things, they need food to provide their cells with energy. The caterpillar will soon go through an amazing transformation to become a beautiful butterfly. These changes require a lot of energy.

    Like this caterpillar and all other living things, you need energy to power everything you do. Whether it&#8217;s running a race or blinking an eye, it takes energy. In fact, every cell of your body constantly needs energy to carry out life processes. You probably know that you get energy from the food you eat, but where does food come from? How does it come to contain energy, and how do your cells get the energy from food? When you read this chapter, you will learn the answers to these questions.

   All living things need
   <strong>
    energy
   </strong>
   , which is defined as the ability to do work. You can often see energy at work in living things&#8212;a bird flies through the air, a firefly glows in the dark, a dog wags its tail. These are obvious ways that living things use energy, but living things constantly use energy in less obvious ways as well.

   Why Living Things Need Energy
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZmMzZTYyY2UwZDI2MWNjZjYzYzYyOWI2OTcxMWU4NmQ.-mjb">
   Inside every cell of all living things, energy is needed to carry out life processes. Energy is required to break down and build up molecules and to transport molecules across plasma membranes. All life&#8217;s work needs energy. A lot of energy is also simply lost to the environment as heat. The story of life is a story of energy flow&#8212;its capture, its change of form, its use for work, and its loss as heat. Energy, unlike matter, cannot be recycled, so organisms require a constant input of energy. Life runs on chemical energy. Where do living organisms get this chemical energy?

ATP is made during the first half of photosynthesis and then used for energy during the second half of photosynthesis, when glucose is made. It is also used for energy by cells for most other cellular processes. ATP releases energy when it gives up one of its three phosphate groups and changes to ADP (adenosine diphosphate [

   Why Organisms Need Both Glucose and ATP
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MTVmZTI5MWU1MzJiMmE2NGE5MWNjMTE4MTk4MDk4MzE.-mpn">
   Why do living things need glucose if ATP is the molecule that cells use for energy? Why don&#8217;t autotrophs just make ATP and be done with it? The answer is in the &#8220;packaging.&#8221; A molecule of glucose contains more chemical energy in a smaller &#8220;package&#8221; than a molecule of ATP. Glucose is also more stable than ATP. Therefore, glucose is better for storing and transporting energy. However, glucose is too powerful for cells to use. ATP, on the other hand, contains just the right amount of energy to power life processes within cells. For these reasons, both glucose and ATP are needed by living things.

   The flow of energy through living organisms begins with photosynthesis. This process stores energy from sunlight in the chemical bonds of glucose. By breaking the chemical bonds in glucose, cells release the stored energy and make the ATP they need. The process in which glucose is broken down and ATP is made is called

   Plants and other autotrophs make food out of &#8220;thin air&#8221;&#8212;at least, they use carbon dioxide from the air to make food. Most food is made in the process of photosynthesis. This process provides more than 99% of the energy used by living things on Earth. Photosynthesis also supplies Earth&#8217;s atmosphere with oxygen.

   Steps of the Light Reactions

   The light reactions occur in several steps, all of which take place in the thylakoid membrane, as shown in

   <li>
    Step 1: Units of sunlight, called photons, strike a molecule of chlorophyll in photosystem II of the thylakoid membrane. The light energy is absorbed by two electrons (2 e
    <sup>
     -
    </sup>
    ) in the chlorophyll molecule, giving them enough energy to leave the molecule.
   </li>
   <li>
    Step 2: At the same time, enzymes in the thylakoid membrane use light energy to split apart a water molecule. This produces:

   <li>
    two electrons (2 e
    <sup>
     -
    </sup>
    ). These electrons replace the two electrons that were lost from the chlorophyll molecule in Step 1.
   </li>
   <li>
    an atom of oxygen (O). This atom combines with another oxygen atom to produce a molecule of oxygen gas (O
    <sub>
     2
    </sub>
    ), which is released as a waste product.
   </li>
   <li>
    two hydrogen ions (2 H
    <sup>
     +
    </sup>
    ). The hydrogen ions, which are positively charged, are released inside the membrane in the thylakoid interior space.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <ul id="x-ck12-ODg2MzAwZjQyMDQwZWJiY2NlZTk3NzM4NWUyMWRmMWU.-ef7">
   <li>
    Step 3: The two excited electrons from Step 1 contain a great deal of energy, so, like hot potatoes, they need something to carry them. They are carried by a series of electron-transport molecules, which make up an
    <strong>
     electron transport chain
    </strong>
    . The two electrons are passed from molecule to molecule down the chain. As this happens, their energy is captured and used to pump more hydrogen ions into the thylakoid interior space.
   </li>
   <li>
    Step 4: When the two electrons reach photosystem I, they are no longer excited. Their energy has been captured and used, and they need more energy. They get energy from light, which is absorbed by chlorophyll in photosystem I. Then, the two re-energized electrons pass down another electron transport chain.
   </li>
   <li>
    Step 5: Enzymes in the thylakoid membrane transfer the newly re-energized electrons to a compound called NADP
    <sup>
     +
    </sup>
    . Along with a hydrogen ion, this produces the energy-carrying molecule NADPH. This molecule is needed to make glucose in the Calvin cycle.
   </li>
   <li>
    Step 6: By now, there is a greater concentration of hydrogen ions&#8212;and positive charge&#8212;in the thylakoid interior space. This difference in concentration and charge creates what is called a chemiosmotic gradient. It causes hydrogen ions to flow back across the thylakoid membrane to the stroma, where their concentration is lower. Like water flowing through a hole in a dam, the hydrogen ions have energy as they flow down the chemiosmotic gradient. The enzyme ATP synthase acts as a channel protein and helps the ions cross the membrane. ATP synthase also uses their energy to add a phosphate group (Pi) to a molecule of ADP, producing a molecule of ATP. The energy in ATP is needed for the Calvin cycle.

   Photosynthesis Stage II: The Calvin Cycle

   The second stage of photosynthesis takes place in the stroma surrounding the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast. The reactions of this stage can occur without light, so they are sometimes called light-independent or dark reactions. This stage of photosynthesis is also known as the Calvin cycle because its reactions were discovered by a scientist named Melvin Calvin. He won a Nobel Prize in 1961 for this important discovery. In the Calvin cycle, chemical energy in NADPH and ATP from the light reactions is used to make glucose. You can follow the Calvin cycle in

   <li>
    Step 1: Carbon Fixation. Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere combines with a simple, five-carbon compound called RuBP. This reaction occurs with the help of an enzyme named RuBisCo and produces molecules known as 3PG (a three-carbon compound, 3-Phosphoglyceric acid).
   </li>
   <li>
    Step 2: Reduction. Molecules of 3PG (from Step 1) gain energy from ATP and NADPH (from the light reactions) and re-arrange themselves to form G3P (glycerate 3-phosphate). This molecule also has three carbon atoms, but it has more energy than 3PG. One of the G3P molecules goes on to form glucose, while the rest of the G3P molecules go on to Step 3.
   </li>
   <li>
    Step 3: Regeneration. The remaining G3P molecules use energy from ATP to form RuBP, the five-carbon molecule that started the Calvin cycle. This allows the cycle to repeat.

   Most autotrophs make food by photosynthesis, but this isn&#8217;t the only way that autotrophs produce food. Some bacteria make food by another process, which uses chemical energy instead of light energy. This process is called
   <strong>
    chemosynthesis
   </strong>
   . Some chemosynthetic bacteria live around deep-ocean vents known as &#8220;black smokers.&#8221; Compounds such as hydrogen sulfide, which flow out of the vents from Earth&#8217;s interior, are used by the bacteria for energy to make food. Consumers that depend on these bacteria to produce food for them include giant tube worms, like these pictured in

   Lesson Summary

  <ul id="x-ck12-NTc0YzliMWUxMjYyZmI3YTI5YTIyM2MxZDY1YmM0MmY.-sxl">
   <li>
    Most autotrophs make food using photosynthesis. This process occurs in two stages: the light reactions and the Calvin cycle.
   </li>
   <li>
    Both stages of photosynthesis take place in chloroplasts. The light reactions take place in the thylakoid membranes, and the Calvin cycle takes place in the stroma.
   </li>
   <li>
    The light reactions capture energy from sunlight, which they change to chemical energy that is stored in molecules of NADPH and ATP. The light reactions also release oxygen gas as a waste product.
   </li>
   <li>
    The reactions of the Calvin cycle add carbon (from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere) to a simple five-carbon molecule called RuBP. These reactions use chemical energy from NADPH and ATP that were produced in the light reactions. The final product of the Calvin cycle is glucose.

   Energy is needed at the start of glycolysis to split the glucose molecule into two pyruvate molecules. These two molecules go on to stage II of cellular respiration. The energy to split glucose is provided by two molecules of ATP. As glycolysis proceeds, energy is released, and the energy is used to make four molecules of ATP. As a result, there is a net gain of two ATP molecules during glycolysis. During this stage, high-energy electrons are also transferred to molecules of NAD

   to produce two molecules of NADH, another energy-carrying molecule. NADH is used in stage III of cellular respiration to make more ATP.

   Anaerobic and Aerobic Respiration
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-NzI5YTNmODA0ODExNWRiNWY3YWJiYmNmNDg2ZDQxODI.-iai">
   Scientists think that glycolysis evolved before the other stages of cellular respiration. This is because the other stages need oxygen, whereas glycolysis does not, and there was no oxygen in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere when life first evolved about 3.5 to 4 billion years ago. Cellular respiration that proceeds without oxygen is called
   <strong>
    anaerobic respiration
   </strong>
   . Then, about 2 or 3 billion years ago, oxygen was gradually added to the atmosphere by early photosynthetic bacteria. After that, living things could use oxygen to break down glucose and make ATP. Today, most organisms make ATP with oxygen. They follow glycolysis with the Krebs cycle and electron transport to make more ATP than by glycolysis alone. Cellular respiration that proceeds in the presence of oxygen is called
   <strong>
    aerobic respiration

   The Krebs cycle itself actually begins when acetyl-CoA combines with a four-carbon molecule called OAA (oxaloacetate) (see

   ). This produces citric acid, which has six carbon atoms. This is why the Krebs cycle is also called the citric acid cycle. After citric acid forms, it goes through a series of reactions that release energy. The energy is captured in molecules of NADH, ATP, and FADH
   <sub>

   </sub>
   , another energy-carrying compound. Carbon dioxide is also released as a waste product of these reactions. The final step of the Krebs cycle regenerates OAA, the molecule that began the Krebs cycle. This molecule is needed for the next turn through the cycle. Two turns are needed because glycolysis produces two pyruvic acid molecules when it splits glucose. Watch the OSU band present the Krebs cycle:

   After the second turn through the Krebs cycle, the original glucose molecule has been broken down completely. All six of its carbon atoms have combined with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. The energy from its chemical bonds has been stored in a total of 16 energy-carrier molecules. These molecules are:

   The pumping of hydrogen ions across the inner membrane creates a greater concentration of the ions in the intermembrane space than in the matrix. This chemiosmotic gradient causes the ions to flow back across the membrane into the matrix, where their concentration is lower. ATP synthase acts as a channel protein, helping the hydrogen ions cross the membrane. It also acts as an enzyme, forming ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. After passing through the electron-transport chain, the &#8220;spent&#8221; electrons combine with oxygen to form water. This is why oxygen is needed; in the absence of oxygen, this process cannot occur. You can see how all these events occur at the following link:

  <ul id="x-ck12-MGNlNGIxNWY4ODQ5MGVlMDM0ODFhZmQxMmJmODJiOWY.-ygd">
   <li>
    Cellular respiration uses energy in glucose to make ATP. Aerobic (&#8220;oxygen-using&#8221;) respiration occurs in three stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and electron transport.
   </li>
   <li>
    In glycolysis, glucose is split into two molecules of pyruvate. This results in a net gain of two ATP molecules.
   </li>
   <li>
    Life first evolved in the absence of oxygen, and glycolysis does not require oxygen. Therefore, glycolysis was probably the earliest way of making ATP from glucose.
   </li>
   <li>
    The Krebs cycle and electron transport occur in the mitochondria. The Krebs cycle takes place in the matrix, and electron transport takes place on the inner membrane.
   </li>
   <li>
    During the Krebs cycle, pyruvate undergoes a series of reactions to produce two more molecules of ATP and also several molecules of NADH and FADH
    <sub>

    </sub>
    .
   </li>
   <li>
    During electron transport, energy from NADH and FADH
    <sub>
     2
    </sub>
    is used to make many more molecules of ATP.

   Today, most living things use oxygen to make ATP from glucose. However, many living things can also make ATP without oxygen. This is true of some plants and fungi and also of many bacteria. These organisms use aerobic respiration when oxygen is present, but when oxygen is in short supply, they use anaerobic respiration instead. Certain bacteria can only use anaerobic respiration. In fact, they may not be able to survive at all in the presence of oxygen.

   Aerobic vs. Anaerobic Respiration: A Comparison
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-M2QxYzM3ODJkOWI1MGNhY2FjODBjZjBhZTU3YTU2MDI.-qxr">
   Aerobic respiration evolved after oxygen was added to Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. This type of respiration is useful today because the atmosphere is now 21% oxygen. However, some anaerobic organisms that evolved before the atmosphere contained oxygen have survived to the present. Therefore, anaerobic respiration must also have advantages.

   Advantages of Aerobic Respiration
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MGMyZTNiMjkxNmE0NzU0ODBhZWYwMGRmMjU1Y2YwMTg.-le4">
   A major advantage of aerobic respiration is the amount of energy it releases. Without oxygen, organisms can just split glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. This releases only enough energy to make two ATP molecules. With oxygen, organisms can break down glucose all the way to carbon dioxide. This releases enough energy to produce up to 38 ATP molecules. Thus, aerobic respiration releases much more energy than anaerobic respiration. The amount of energy produced by aerobic respiration may explain why aerobic organisms came to dominate life on Earth. It may also explain how organisms were able to become multicellular and increase in size.

   Advantages of Anaerobic Respiration
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZjQ2OGNmOGZjNmRhNzIzOTlmNjRlMzNlYjQ2ZGRjZDY.-sc3">
   One advantage of anaerobic respiration is obvious. It lets organisms live in places where there is little or no oxygen. Such places include deep water, soil, and the digestive tracts of animals such as humans (see

   Another advantage of anaerobic respiration is its speed. It produces ATP very quickly. For example, it lets your muscles get the energy they need for short bursts of intense activity (see

   <li>
    Fermentation is a way of making ATP from glucose without oxygen. There are two types of fermentation: lactic acid fermentation and alcoholic fermentation.
   </li>
   <li>
    Lactic acid fermentation changes pyruvic acid to lactic acid and forms NAD
    <sup>

    </sup>
    . The NAD
    <sup>
     +
    </sup>
    allows glycolysis to continue so it can make more ATP.
   </li>
   <li>
    Alcohol fermentation changes pyruvic acid to ethanol and carbon dioxide and forms NAD
    <sup>
     +
    </sup>
    . Again, the NAD
    <sup>
     +
    </sup>
    allows glycolysis to keep making ATP.
   </li>
   <li>
    Aerobic respiration produces much more ATP than anaerobic respiration. However, anaerobic respiration occurs more quickly.
