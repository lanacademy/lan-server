    What alien planet is represented by this picture? Would it surprise you to learn that the picture represents Earth? After Earth first formed about 4.6 billion years ago, it may well have looked like this. Instead of rivers of water, rivers of molten rock flowed over its surface. Life as we know it could not have survived in such a place. How did this fiery hot planet become today&#8217;s Earth, covered with water and teeming with life? The long and incredible story of Earth&#8217;s history is told in this chapter.

   Introduction

  <p id="x-ck12-Mjk2NjMyNzc0OTdhZTUzNzkxYTRiNGQ5MGY1NTVlYmE.-rwu">
   Earth formed 4.6 billion years ago, and life first appeared about 4 billion years ago. The first life forms were microscopic, single-celled organisms. From these simple beginnings, evolution gradually produced the vast complexity and diversity of life today. The evolution of life on Earth wasn&#8217;t always smooth and steady&#8212;far from it. Living things had to cope with some astounding changes. Giant meteorites struck Earth&#8217;s surface. Continents drifted and shifted. Ice ages buried the planet in snow and ice for millions of years at a time. At least five times, many, if not most, of Earth&#8217;s living things went extinct.
   <strong>
    Extinction
   </strong>
   occurs when a species completely dies out and no members of the species remain. But life on Earth was persistent. Each time, it came back more numerous and diverse than before.

   are the preserved remains or traces of organisms that lived in the past. The soft parts of organisms almost always decompose quickly after death. On occasion, the hard parts&#8212;mainly bones, teeth, or shells&#8212;remain long enough to mineralize and form fossils. An example of a complete fossil skeleton is shown in

   In order for fossils to &#8220;tell&#8221; us the story of life, they must be dated. Then they can help scientists reconstruct how life changed over time. Fossils can be dated in two different ways: relative dating and absolute dating. Both are described below. You can also learn more about dating methods in the video at this link:

     Relative dating
    </strong>
    determines which of two fossils is older or younger than the other, but not their age in years. Relative dating is based on the positions of fossils in rock layers. Lower layers were laid down earlier, so they are assumed to contain older fossils. This is illustrated in

   Evidence from the fossil record can be combined with data from molecular clocks. A
   <strong>
    molecular clock
   </strong>
   uses DNA sequences (or the proteins they encode) to estimate how long it has been since related species diverged from a common ancestor. Molecular clocks are based on the assumption that mutations accumulate through time at a steady average rate for a given region of DNA. Species that have accumulated greater differences in their DNA sequences are assumed to have diverged from their common ancestor in the more distant past. Molecular clocks based on different regions of DNA may be used together for more accuracy. Consider the example in

  <p id="x-ck12-NTRiMmQ5N2M0NjM3MzU4MzU2ZGU1MmZlOGE3ZDRiOTE.-ewu">
   We&#8217;ll start the story of life at the very beginning, when Earth and the rest of the solar system first formed. The solar system began as a rotating cloud of stardust. Then, a nearby star exploded and sent a shock wave through the dust cloud, increasing its rate of spin. As a result, most of the mass became concentrated in the middle of the disk, forming the sun. Smaller concentrations of mass rotating around the center formed the planets, including Earth. You can watch a video showing how Earth formed at this link:

   . At first, Earth was molten and lacked an atmosphere and oceans. Gradually, the planet cooled and formed a solid crust. As the planet continued to cool, volcanoes released gases, which eventually formed an atmosphere. The early atmosphere contained ammonia, methane, water vapor, and carbon dioxide but only a trace of oxygen. As the atmosphere became denser, clouds formed and rain fell. Water from rain (and perhaps also from comets and asteroids that stuck Earth) eventually formed the oceans. The ancient atmosphere and oceans represented by the picture in

   The First Organic Molecules
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-NTA3YjhiZjIxMDA4MThkNzViZjRjOWMwNjJhZDRhMDQ.-qsb">
   All living things consist of organic molecules. Therefore, it is likely that organic molecules evolved before cells, perhaps as long as 4 billion years ago. How did these building blocks of life first form? Scientists think that lightning sparked chemical reactions in Earth&#8217;s early atmosphere. They hypothesize that this created a &#8220;soup&#8221; of organic molecules from inorganic chemicals. In 1953, scientists Stanley Miller and Harold Urey used their imaginations to test this hypothesis. They created a simulation experiment to see if organic molecules could arise in this way (see

   Recently, the findings of Miller and Urey have come into question due to discrepancies in the composition of the early atmosphere, allowing a number of other ideas to surface on the formation of the first organic molecules. One idea states that the active volcanoes on early Earth gave the necessary materials for life. Despite the simplified account discussed above, the problem of the origin of the first organic compounds remains. Despite tremendous advances in biochemical analysis, answers to the problem remain. But whatever process did result in the first organic molecules, it was probably a spontaneous process, with elements coming together randomly to form small compounds, and small compounds reacting with other elements and other small compounds to make larger compounds. So, which organic molecule did come first?

   Living things need organic molecules to store genetic information and to carry out the chemical work of cells. Modern organisms use DNA to store genetic information and proteins to catalyze chemical reactions. So, did DNA or proteins evolve first? This is like asking whether the chicken or the egg came first. DNA encodes proteins and proteins are needed to make DNA, so each type of organic molecule needs the other for its own existence. How could either of these two molecules have evolved before the other? Did some other organic molecule evolve first, instead of DNA or proteins?

   RNA World Hypothesis
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NzJjYzc0MTQwOTY1NDI3NzU5OTM1MzU5ZjRiNDlkY2M.-04a">
   Some scientists speculate that RNA may have been the first organic molecule to evolve. In fact, they think that early life was based solely on RNA and that DNA and proteins evolved later. This is called the
   <strong>
    RNA world hypothesis.
   </strong>
   Why RNA? It can encode genetic instructions (like DNA), and some RNAs can carry out chemical reactions (like proteins). Therefore, it solves the chicken-and-egg problem of which of these two molecules came first. Other evidence also suggests that RNA may be the most ancient of the organic molecules.

   How organic molecules such as RNA developed into cells is not known for certain. Scientists speculate that lipid membranes grew around the organic molecules. The membranes prevented the molecules from reacting with other molecules, so they did not form new compounds. In this way, the organic molecules persisted, and the first cells may have formed.

   Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration

   The earliest cells were probably heterotrophs. Most likely they got their energy from other molecules in the organic &#8220;soup.&#8221; However, by about 3 billion years ago, a new way of obtaining energy evolved. This new way was photosynthesis. Through photosynthesis, organisms could use sunlight to make food from carbon dioxide and water. These organisms were the first autotrophs. They provided food for themselves and for other organisms that began to consume them. After photosynthesis evolved, oxygen started to accumulate in the atmosphere. This has been dubbed the &#8220;oxygen catastrophe.&#8221; Why? Oxygen was toxic to most early cells because they had evolved in its absence. As a result, many of them died out. The few that survived evolved a new way to take advantage of the oxygen. This second major innovation was cellular respiration. It allowed cells to use oxygen to obtain more energy from organic molecules.

They shared the food with the large cell. They became the chloroplasts of eukaryotic cells. With their specialized organelles, eukaryotic cells were powerful and efficient. They would go on to evolve additional major adaptations. These adaptations include sexual reproduction, cell specialization, and multicellularity.

   Arsenic in Place of Phosphorus - New Biochemicals for Life?
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-N2U4N2Q5NGNhOWI4NmFlMDkxZjUwZWIzODNkMmRlNWU.-p3z">
   In late 2010, NASA scientists proposed the notion that the elements essential for life - carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur - may have additional members. Scientists have trained a bacterium to eat and grow on a diet of arsenic, in place of phosphorus. Phosphorus chains form the backbone of DNA, and ATP, with three phosphates, is the principal molecule in which energy is stored in the cell. Arsenic is directly under phosphorus in the Periodic Table, so the two elements have similar chemical bonding properties. This finding raises the possibility that organisms could exist on Earth or elsewhere in the universe using biochemicals not currently known to exist. These results expand the notion of what life could be and where it could be. It could be possible that life on other planets may have formed using biochemicals with elements different from the elements used in life on Earth.

   <li>
    Much of what we know about the history of life on Earth is based on the fossil record. Molecular clocks are used to estimate how long it has been since two species diverged from a common ancestor. The geologic time scale is another important tool for understanding the history of life on Earth.
   </li>
   <li>
    Earth formed about 4.6 billion years ago. At first, Earth was molten and lacked an atmosphere and oceans. Gradually, the atmosphere formed, followed by the oceans.
   </li>
   <li>
    The first organic molecules formed about 4 billion years ago. This may have happened when lightning sparked chemical reactions in Earth&#8217;s early atmosphere. RNA may have been the first organic molecule to form as well as the basis of early life.
   </li>
   <li>
    The first cells consisted of little more than an organic molecule such as RNA inside a lipid membrane. One cell (or group of cells), called the last universal common ancestor (LUCA), gave rise to all subsequent life on Earth. Photosynthesis evolved by 3 billion years ago and released oxygen into the atmosphere. Cellular respiration evolved after that to make use of the oxygen.
   </li>
   <li>
    Eukaryotic cells probably evolved about 2 billion years ago. Their evolution is explained by endosymbiotic theory. Eukaryotic cells would go on to evolve into the diversity of eukaryotes we know today.

    Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere rose and fell. This was due to volcanic activity and other factors. When the levels were high, they created a greenhouse effect.

Several times, cooling was severe enough to plunge Earth into an ice age. One ice age was so cold that snow and ice completely covered the planet (see

    Some cells started to live together in colonies. In some colonies, cells started to specialize in doing different jobs. This made the cells more efficient as a colony than as individual cells.

   , many or even most species abruptly disappear from Earth. There have been five mass extinctions in Earth&#8217;s history. Many scientists think we are currently going through a sixth mass extinction. What caused the Precambrian mass extinction? A combination of climatic and geologic events was probably responsible. No matter what the cause, the extinction paved the way for a burst of new life during the following Paleozoic Era.

   In the mass extinction that ended the Permian, the majority of species went extinct. Many hypotheses have been offered to explain why this mass extinction occurred. These include huge meteorites striking Earth and enormous volcanoes spewing ashes and gases into the atmosphere. Both could have darkened the skies with dust for many months. This, in turn, would have shut down photosynthesis and cooled the planet. Despite the great loss of life, there was light at the end of the tunnel. The Permian extinction paved the way for another burst of new life at the start of the following Mesozoic Era. This included the evolution of the dinosaurs.

   : During the Quaternary Period (1.8 million years ago&#8211;present), Earth&#8217;s climate cooled, leading to a series of ice ages. Sea levels fell because so much water was frozen in glaciers. This created land bridges between continents, allowing land animals to move to new areas. Some mammals, like the woolly mammoths adapted to the cold by evolving very large size and thick fur. Other animals moved closer to the equator or went extinct, along with many plants.

    During the late Precambrian, continents drifted, carbon dioxide levels fluctuated, and climates changed. Many organisms could not survive the changes and died out. Others evolved important new adaptations. These include sexual reproduction, cell specialization, and multicellularity. The Precambrian ended with a mass extinction. It paved the way for the Cambrian explosion.

    The Cenozoic Era is the age of mammals. They evolved to fill virtually all the niches vacated by dinosaurs. The ice ages of the Quaternary Period of the Cenozoic led to many extinctions. The last ice age ended 12,000 years ago. By that time,
    <em>
     Homo sapiens

   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-NTA2M2EzZWEyNTAzZjQ1YWVmNzc0ZTg1YThiZDY4ODY.-9rf">
   The evolution of life on Earth over the past 4 billion years has resulted in a huge variety of species. For more than 2,000 years, humans have been trying to classify the great diversity of life. The science of classifying organisms is called
   <strong>
    taxonomy.
   </strong>
   Classification is an important step in understanding the present diversity and past evolutionary history of life on Earth.
  </p>
  <h2 id="x-ck12-TGlubmFlYW4gQ2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24._2-juu">
   Linnaean Classification
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZTYwNzJmMjJiNzA4ODhjMzlkOGJiNjcxYmY5YjBiOTA.-uwm">
   All modern classification systems have their roots in the
   <strong>
    Linnaean classification system.
   </strong>
   It was developed by Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus in the 1700s. He tried to classify all living things that were known at his time. He grouped together organisms that shared obvious physical traits, such as number of legs or shape of leaves. For his contribution, Linnaeus is known as the &#8220;father of taxonomy.&#8221; You can learn more about Linnaeus and his system of classification by watching the video at this link:
   <a href="http://teachertube.com/viewVideo.php?video_id=169889">
    http://teachertube.com/viewVideo.php?video_id=169889
   </a>
   . The Linnaean system of classification consists of a hierarchy of groupings, called
   <strong>
    taxa
   </strong>
   (singular, taxon). Taxa range from the kingdom to the species (see
   <strong>
    Figure
   </strong>
   <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTA5LTE0LUNsYXNzaWZpY2F0aW9u">
    below
   </a>
   ). The
   <strong>
    kingdom
   </strong>
   is the largest and most inclusive grouping. It consists of organisms that share just a few basic similarities. Examples are the plant and animal kingdoms. The
   <strong>
    species
   </strong>
   is the smallest and most exclusive grouping. It consists of organisms that are similar enough to produce fertile offspring together. Closely related species are grouped together in a
   <strong>
    genus.

   Binomial Nomenclature
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MGExNGNkZmMwMGQwYTcyNjkwZDY2MTM5ZTFhYTE3ZDA.-syx">
   Perhaps the single greatest contribution Linnaeus made to science was his method of naming species. This method, called
   <strong>
    binomial nomenclature
   </strong>
   , gives each species a unique, two-word Latin name consisting of the genus name and the species name. An example is
   <em>
    Homo sapiens
   </em>
   , the two-word Latin name for humans. It literally means &#8220;wise human.&#8221; This is a reference to our big brains. Why is having two names so important? It is similar to people having a first and a last name. You may know several people with the first name Michael, but adding Michael&#8217;s last name usually pins down exactly whom you mean. In the same way, having two names uniquely identifies a species.

   Revisions in Linnaean Classification
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZjdhN2EyNGIyZjdhYWFmNmFlMWNlMDUzN2ZhZTI1ZDk.-whm">
   Linnaeus published his classification system in the 1700s. Since then, many new species have been discovered. The biochemistry of organisms has also become known. Eventually, scientists realized that Linnaeus&#8217;s system of classification needed revision. A major change to the Linnaean system was the addition of a new taxon called the domain. A
   <strong>
    domain
   </strong>
   is a taxon that is larger and more inclusive than the kingdom. Most biologists agree there are three domains of life on Earth: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota (see
   <strong>
    Figure
   </strong>
   <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTA5LTE1LVRocmVlLURvbWFpbi1DbGFzc2lmaWNhdGlvbg..">

   </a>
   ). Both Bacteria and Archaea consist of single-celled prokaryotes. Eukaryota consists of all eukaryotes, from single-celled protists to humans. This domain includes the Animalia (animals), Plantae (plants), Fungi (fungi), and Protista (protists) kingdoms.

   Phylogenetic Classification
  </h2>

   Linnaeus classified organisms based on obvious physical traits. Basically, organisms were grouped together if they looked alike. After Darwin published his theory of evolution in the 1800s (discussed in the following chapter), scientists looked for a way to classify organisms that showed phylogeny.
   <strong>

   </strong>
   is the evolutionary history of a group of related organisms. It is represented by a
