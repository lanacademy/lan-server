   Many people have compared the human body to a machine. Think about some common machines, such as drills and washing machines. Each machine consists of many parts, and each part does a specific job, yet all the parts work together to perform an overall function. The human body is like a machine in all these ways. In fact, it may be the most fantastic machine on Earth, as you will discover when you learn more about it in this and the remaining chapters of this FlexBook.

   The most basic parts of the human machine are cells&#8212;an amazing 100 trillion of them by the time the average person reaches adulthood! Cells are the basic units of structure and function in the human body, as they are in all living things. Each cell carries out basic life processes that allow the body to survive. Many human cells are specialized in form and function, as shown in

   A Well-Oiled Machine
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-YzMzMWU2YTg4YmQ0MTMyNTZmODVkODAxMzdhYjMwODI.-rpv">
   All of the organs and organ systems of the human body work together like a well-oiled machine. This is because they are closely regulated by the nervous and endocrine systems. The nervous system controls virtually all body activities, and the endocrine system secretes hormones that regulate these activities. Functioning together, the organ systems supply body cells with all the substances they need and eliminate their wastes. They also keep temperature, pH, and other conditions at just the right levels to support life processes.

   Maintaining Homeostasis
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-Y2VlOTBkZWJmYTFlYTFkZGIxYjRkMDY2ZTNiMTljNDI.-rkk">
   The process in which organ systems work to maintain a stable internal environment is called homeostasis. Keeping a stable internal environment requires constant adjustments. Here are just three of the many ways that human organ systems help the body maintain homeostasis:
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-OTA2ZTljZDJlMGZhNGE1MzhjNTc3N2YyMmM4MTIwMDk.-xqp">
   <li>
    Respiratory system: A high concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood triggers faster breathing. The lungs exhale more frequently, which removes carbon dioxide from the body more quickly.
   </li>
   <li>
    Excretory system: A low level of water in the blood triggers retention of water by the kidneys. The kidneys produce more concentrated urine, so less water is lost from the body.
   </li>
   <li>
    Endocrine system: A high concentration of sugar in the blood triggers secretion of insulin by an endocrine gland called the pancreas. Insulin is a hormone that helps cells absorb sugar from the blood.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="x-ck12-RmFpbHVyZSBvZiBIb21lb3N0YXNpcw..-hkv">
   Failure of Homeostasis
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MTk1ZjhjZmE0NWQ3ZDEyMmRjNjViMDBhZDc3MmM0MTA.-jvp">
   Many homeostatic mechanisms such as these work continuously to maintain stable conditions in the human body. Sometimes, however, the mechanisms fail. When they do, cells may not get everything they need, or toxic wastes may accumulate in the body. If homeostasis is not restored, the imbalance may lead to disease or even death.

   consists of all the bones of the body. How important are your bones? Try to imagine what you would look like without them. You would be a soft, wobbly pile of skin, muscles, and internal organs, so you might look something like a very large slug. Not that you would be able to see yourself&#8212;folds of skin would droop down over your eyes and block your vision because of your lack of skull bones. You could push the skin out of the way, if you could only move your arms, but you need bones for that as well!

   The skeleton supports the body and gives it shape. It has several other functions as well, including:

  <ol id="x-ck12-ZTgyMmIzMzBkNDBiNDY4NWViYWNiYWE2OGJkZTIxY2Q.-9dt" class="x-ck12-decimal">

  </ol>
  <p id="x-ck12-NmVmMmQ1NDliNGM2MWM4NDY3MGUwZmM5NTEzYWExYTA.-jw0">
   Maintaining mineral homeostasis is a very important function of the skeleton, because just the right levels of calcium and other minerals are needed in the blood for normal functioning of the body. When mineral levels in the blood are too high, bones absorb some of the minerals and store them as mineral salts, which is why bones are so hard. When blood levels of minerals are too low, bones release some of the minerals back into the blood, thus restoring homeostasis.

   Structure of Bones
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-OWU3ZmM3OWQwYzUxOWVmNzc2NTU5ZTBhNDcwNjBjZjk.-ig6">
   Many people think of bones as being dead, dry, and brittle. These adjectives correctly describe the bones of a preserved skeleton, but the bones in a living human being are very much alive. As shown in
   <strong>
    Figure
   </strong>
   <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTIxLTA2LWJvbmUtbWF0cml4">

   </a>
   , the basic structure of bones is
   <strong>
    bone matrix
   </strong>
   , which forms the underlying rigid framework of bones, formed of both compact and spongy bone. The bone matrix consists of tough protein fibers&#8212;mainly collagen&#8212;that become hard and rigid due to mineralization with calcium crystals. Bone matrix is crisscrossed by blood vessels and nerves and also contains specialized bone cells that are actively involved in metabolic processes.

   Bone Cells
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MDNlOTIxMTEyYTFkNzYyMDY1YmRhZDhmMGMzMTQ1ZTk.-lkb">
   There are three types of specialized cells in human bones: osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts. These cells are responsible for bone growth and mineral homeostasis.
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-YWZkZDM3M2JhMDRiNzNlNTU3NzFlMGY3Y2Y0MzNhODc.-pd7">
   <li>
    <strong>
     Osteoblasts
    </strong>
    make new bone cells and secrete collagen that mineralizes to become bone matrix. They are responsible for bone growth and the uptake of minerals from the blood.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Osteocytes
    </strong>
    regulate mineral homeostasis. They direct the uptake of minerals from the blood and the release of minerals back into the blood as needed.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Osteoclasts
    </strong>
    dissolve minerals in bone matrix and release them back into the blood.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p id="x-ck12-Y2FmMDgwMTRjYWY0MDZiM2QyMjA5MDJjYzQ3OTI1YTU.-2uq">
   Bones are far from static, or unchanging. Instead, they are dynamic, living tissues that are constantly being reshaped. Under the direction of osteocytes, osteoblasts continuously build up bone, while osteoclasts continuously break it down. You can watch an animated video of these processes in bone at

   Growth and Development of Bones
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZjBlYmZjMzQyYzAzYWQ4NTRmNzJhZmIwMWQzNGM0Mzg.-dcu">
   Early in the development of a human fetus, the skeleton is made entirely of cartilage. The relatively soft cartilage gradually turns into hard bone through
   <strong>
    ossification
   </strong>
   . This is a process in which mineral deposits replace cartilage. As shown in
   <strong>
    Figure
   </strong>
   <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTIxLTA4LUJvbmUtZ3Jvd3Ro">
    below
   </a>
   , ossification of long bones, which are found in the arms and legs, begins at the center of the bones and continues toward the ends. By birth, several areas of cartilage remain in the skeleton, including the ends of the long bones. This cartilage grows as the long bones grow, so the bones can keep increasing in length during childhood.

   In the late teens or early twenties, a person reaches skeletal maturity. By then, all of the cartilage has been replaced by bone, so no further growth in bone length is possible. However, bones can still increase in thickness. This may occur in response to increased muscle activity, such as weight training.

   <strong>
    joint
   </strong>
   is a place where two or more bones of the skeleton meet. With the help of muscles, joints work like mechanical levers, allowing the body to move with relatively little force. The surfaces of bones at joints are covered with a smooth layer of cartilage that reduces friction at the points of contact between the bones.

   </strong>
   consists of all the muscles of the body. Does the word
   <em>

   make you think of the bulging biceps of a weightlifter, like the man in

   ? Muscles such as biceps that move the body are easy to feel and see, but they aren&#8217;t the only muscles in the human body. Many muscles are deep within the body. They form the walls of internal organs such as the heart and stomach. You can flex your biceps like a body builder but you cannot control the muscles inside you. It&#8217;s a good thing that they work on their own without any conscious effort your part, because movement of these muscles is essential for survival.

   What Are Muscles?
  </h2>

   Muscles are organs composed mainly of muscle cells, which are also called
   <strong>
    muscle fibers
   </strong>
   . Each muscle fiber is a very long, thin cell that can do something no other cell can do. It can contract, or shorten. Muscle contractions are responsible for virtually all the movements of the body, both inside and out. There are three types of muscle tissues in the human body: cardiac, smooth, and skeletal muscle tissues. They are shown in

   Muscle tissue in the walls of internal organs such as the stomach and intestines is
   <strong>
    smooth muscle
   </strong>
   . When smooth muscle contracts, it helps the organs carry out their functions. For example, when smooth muscle in the stomach contracts, it squeezes the food inside the stomach, which helps break the food into smaller pieces. Contractions of smooth muscle are involuntary. This means they are not under conscious control.

   ). Many skeletal muscles are attached to the ends of bones that meet at a joint. The muscles span the joint and connect the bones. When the muscles contract, they pull on the bones, causing them to move. You can watch a video showing how muscles and bones move together at this link:

   </a>
   . Muscles can only contract. They cannot actively extend, or lengthen. Therefore, to move bones in opposite directions, pairs of muscles must work in opposition. For example, the biceps and triceps muscles of the upper arm work in opposition to bend and extend the arm at the elbow (see

Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles.

   Each muscle fiber contains hundreds of organelles called myofibrils. Each myofibril is made up of two types of protein filaments: actin filaments, which are thinner, and myosin filaments, which are thicker. Actin filaments are anchored to structures called Z lines (see

   Sliding Filament Theory
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-M2Y4Yzg4MmM4YzY1MjgzNDM1MWQxNDIwMWEyZDM4Yjk.-l5h">
   The most widely accepted theory explaining how muscle fibers contract is called the
   <strong>
    sliding filament theory
   </strong>
   . According to this theory, myosin filaments use energy from ATP to &#8220;walk&#8221; along the actin filaments with their cross bridges. This pulls the actin filaments closer together. The movement of the actin filaments also pulls the Z lines closer together, thus shortening the sarcomere. You can watch this occurring in a video animation at
   <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V-zFVnFkWg&amp;feature=related">
    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V-zFVnFkWg&amp;feature=related
   </a>
   . When all of the sarcomeres in a muscle fiber shorten, the fiber contracts. A muscle fiber either contracts fully or it doesn&#8217;t contract at all. The number of fibers that contract determines the strength of the muscular force. When more fibers contract at the same time, the force is greater.

   Muscles and Nerves
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-OWY5NDlhOTU5NGQwNTViZmEwM2ViMWRhZTk1NWI1Y2Y.-cw8">
   Muscles cannot contract on their own. They need a stimulus from a nerve cell to &#8220;tell&#8221; them to contract. Let&#8217;s say you decide to raise your hand in class. Your brain sends electrical messages to nerve cells, called motor neurons, in your arm and shoulder. The motor neurons, in turn, stimulate muscle fibers in your arm and shoulder to contract, causing your arm to rise. Involuntary contractions of cardiac and smooth muscles are also controlled by nerves.

   Lesson Summary
  </h2>
  <ul id="x-ck12-YWNiZGYyZDZhYTQ0NjQ0M2MxYmE3ZGM4OGRkODczMjM.-jo4">
   <li>
    There are three types of human muscle tissue: smooth muscle (in internal organs), skeletal muscle, and cardiac muscle (only in the heart).
   </li>
   <li>
    Skeletal muscles are attached to the skeleton and cause bones to move when they contract.
   </li>
   <li>
    According to the sliding filament theory, a muscle fiber contracts when myosin filaments pull actin filaments closer together and thus shorten sarcomeres within a fiber. When all the sarcomeres in a muscle fiber shorten, the fiber contracts.

   ). For example, there are no nerve endings or blood vessels in the epidermis. The innermost cells of the epidermis are continuously dividing through mitosis to form new cells. The newly formed cells move up through the epidermis toward the skin surface, while producing a tough, fibrous protein called keratin. The cells become filled with keratin and die by the time they reach the surface, where they form a protective, waterproof layer called the stratum corneum. The dead cells are gradually shed from the surface of the skin and replaced by other cells.

   <strong>
    Melanin
   </strong>
   is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D. Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency.

   Functions of the Skin

   The skin has multiple roles in the body. Many of these roles are related to homeostasis. The skin&#8217;s main functions are preventing water loss from the body and serving as a barrier to the entry of microorganisms. In addition, melanin in the skin blocks UV light and protects deeper layers from its damaging effects.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-YmY3YmU0YzQwYjU4Y2ZmMTIzMGZjZDcyNTBkODAzMGI.-ba7">
   The skin also helps regulate body temperature. When the body is too warm, sweat is released by the sweat glands and spreads over the skin surface. As the sweat evaporates, it cools the body. Blood vessels in the skin also dilate, or widen, when the body is too warm. This allows more blood to flow through the skin, bringing body heat to the surface, where it radiates into the environment. When the body is too cool, sweat glands stop producing sweat, and blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow, thus conserving body heat.

    Acne is a condition in which red bumps called pimples form on the skin due to a bacterial infection. It affects more than 85 percent of teens and may continue into adulthood. The underlying cause of acne is excessive secretion of sebum, which plugs hair follicles and makes them good breeding grounds for bacteria. At the following link, you can watch an animation showing how acne develops:

    Skin cancer is a disease in which skin cells grow out of control. It is caused mainly by excessive exposure to UV light. People with lighter skin are at greater risk of developing skin cancer because they have less melanin to block harmful UV radiation. The best way to prevent skin cancer is to avoid UV exposure by using sunscreen and wearing protective clothing.

   Hair helps to insulate and protect the body. Head hair is especially important in preventing heat loss from the body. Eyelashes and eyebrows protect the eyes from water, dirt, and other irritants. Hairs in the nose trap dust particles and microorganisms in the air and prevent them from reaching the lungs. Hair also provides sensory input when objects brush against it or it sways in moving air.

   Lesson Summary
  </h2>
  <ul id="x-ck12-NjBmNmQ0M2NkY2RjN2E2NzRlODA4MmEwNjkxNGVhMzM.-1o8">
   <li>
    The skin consists of two layers: the epidermis, which contains mainly epithelial cells, and the dermis, which contains most of skin&#8217;s other structures, including blood vessels, nerve endings, hair follicles, and glands.
   </li>
   <li>
    Skin protects the body from injury, water loss, and microorganisms. It also plays a major role in maintaining a stable body temperature. Common skin problems include acne and skin cancer.
   </li>
   <li>
    Nails and hair contain mostly keratin. They protect the body and enhance the sense of touch.
