    This may look like a scary creature from your worst nightmare, but it wouldn&#8217;t hurt a fly. In fact, it is a fly! The picture shows the charming portrait of a horsefly, up close and personal. Those big, striped, colorful orbs are its eyes. Did you ever look through a kaleidoscope? If so, then you have an idea of what the world looks like to a horsefly.

   Introduction

  <p id="x-ck12-MDljYzc1ZDBhNGZjNzViM2EzMjcxM2Y5Y2Y2YjcwMTI.-ctl">
   Invertebrates are animals without a backbone. They are the most numerous animals on Earth. Most invertebrates are insects. However, simpler invertebrates evolved before insects. Some&#8212;like the sponges you will read about next&#8212;have existed virtually unchanged for hundreds of millions of years. Their continued existence is evidence that they are well adapted for their habitats. They also evolved some of the most important traits that are found in almost all animals today. Without the traits that evolved in sponges and other simple invertebrates, you would not exist.

   Structure and Function of Sponges
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-Zjg5MWY3MGM5YTMwZWRmZjZiMjQwZDczNzIwNmFlYzQ.-o0z">
   Sponges come in a variety of shapes and sizes. For example, they may be shaped like tubes, fans, cones, or just blobs. They range in diameter from about a centimeter (0.4 inches) to over a meter (3.3 feet). Many species live in colonies that may be quite large. Adult sponges are
   <strong>
    sessile.
   </strong>
   This means they are unable to move from place to place. Root-like projections anchor them to solid surfaces such as rocks and reefs.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZDUzNjAyNTQxNTI5NWVjMGQwMzEyYThiNzA3MWNiZWQ.-xqr">
   Sponges have an internal skeleton that gives them support and protection. An internal skeleton is called an
   <strong>
    endoskeleton.
   </strong>
   A sponge endoskeleton consists of short, sharp rods called spicules (see
   <strong>
    Figure
   </strong>
   <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTAyLXNwb25nZS1hbmF0b215">

   ). Spicules are made of silica, calcium carbonate, or spongin, a tough protein. They grow from specialized cells in the body of the sponge.

   Sponges are
   <strong>
    filter feeders.
   </strong>
   They pump water into their body through their pores. The water flows through a large central cavity called the spongocoel (see
   <strong>

   </strong>
   <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTAyLXNwb25nZS1hbmF0b215">

   </a>
   ). As the water flows by, specialized collar cells filter out food particles such as bacteria. Collar cells have tiny hairs that trap the particles. They also have a flagellum that whips the water and keeps it moving. Once the food is trapped, the collar cells digest it (see
   <strong>
    Figure
   </strong>
   <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTAzLWNvbGxhci1jZWxs">
    below
   </a>
   ). Cells called amebocytes also help digest the food. They distribute the nutrients to the rest of the body as well. Finally, the water flows back out of the body through an opening called the osculum. As water flows through the sponge, oxygen diffuses from the water to the sponge&#8217;s cells. The cells also expel wastes into the water for removal through the osculum.

   shows the sponge life cycle when sexual reproduction is involved. Adult sponges produce eggs and sperm. In many species, the same individuals produce both. However, they don&#8217;t produce eggs and sperm at the same time. As a result, self-fertilization is unlikely to occur. What is an advantage of avoiding self-fertilization?

   Sperm are released into the surrounding water through the osculum. If they enter a female sponge through a pore, they may be trapped by collar cells. Trapped sperm are delivered to eggs inside the female body, where fertilization takes place. The resulting zygote develops into a larva. Unlike the adult, the larva is motile. It is covered with cilia that propel it through the water. As the larva grows, it becomes more similar to an adult sponge and loses its ability to swim.

   Ecology of Sponges
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MzkxYjg3YjMxNzNhMDM2YTE1MDljY2M4NmE4ZGE2ZDE.-zyp">
   Sponges that live on coral reefs have symbiotic relationships with other reef species. They provide shelter for algae, shrimp, and crabs. In return, they get nutrients from the metabolism of the organisms they shelter. Sponges are a source of food for many species of fish. Because sponges are sessile, they cannot flee from predators. Their sharp spicules provide some defense. They also produce toxins that may poison predators that try to eat them.

Digestion takes place in the coelenteron. Nutrients are absorbed and gases exchanged through the cells lining this cavity. Fluid in the coelenteron creates a hydrostatic skeleton. Cnidarians have a simple nervous system consisting of a nerve net that can detect touch. They may also have other sensory structures. For example, jellyfish have light-sensing structures and gravity-sensing structures. These senses give them a sense of up versus down. It also helps them balance.

Sexual reproduction forms a zygote. The zygote develops into a larva called a planula. The planula, in turn, develops into a polyp. There are many variations on the general life cycle. Obviously, species that exist only as polyps or medusae have a life cycle without the other form.

   Cnidarians can be found in almost all ocean habitats. They may live in water that is shallow or deep, warm or cold. A few species live in freshwater. Some cnidarians live alone, while others live in colonies. Corals form large colonies in shallow tropical water. They are confined to shallow water because they have a mutualistic relationship with algae that live inside them. The algae need sunlight for photosynthesis, so they must be relatively close to the surface of the water. Corals exist only as polyps. They catch plankton with their tentacles. Many secrete a calcium carbonate exoskeleton. Over time, this builds up to become a coral reef (see

   Structure and Function of Flatworms
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NTEwYWYwOWY2NWQwNmE4MzA2NjZiNzMxMWM1NzUwZDM.-ql9">
   Flatworms range in length from about 1 millimeter (0.04 inches) to more than 20 meters (66 feet). They have a flat body because they do not have a coelom or even a pseudocoelom. They also lack a respiratory system. Instead, their cells exchange gases by diffusion directly with the environment. Their digestive system is incomplete.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-OGRjNTg1M2M4M2UyOGZlZmEzYTRkNDE1Y2FjZGRjMTA.-4p8">
   Flatworms reflect several major evolutionary advances in invertebrates. They have three embryonic cell layers, including mesoderm. The mesoderm layer allows them to develop organ systems. For example, they have muscular and excretory systems. The muscular system allows them to move from place to place over solid surfaces. The excretory system lets them maintain a proper balance of water and salts. Flatworms also show cephalization and bilateral symmetry.

   Flatworm Reproduction
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-OWJlZjc2OGFhNjVmMDEyZDU0NjEzZWFkODVlNjBiNDA.-9au">
   Flatworms reproduce sexually. In most species, the same individuals produce both eggs and sperm. After fertilization occurs, the fertilized eggs pass out of the adult&#8217;s body and hatch into larvae. There may be several different larval stages. The final larval stage develops into the adult form, and the life cycle repeats.

   Both flukes and tapeworms are parasites with vertebrate hosts, including human hosts. Flukes live in the host&#8217;s circulatory system or liver. Tapeworms live in the host&#8217;s digestive system. Usually, more than one type of host is required to complete the parasite&#8217;s life cycle. Look at the life cycle of the liver fluke in

   Structure and Function of Roundworms
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-YjgwMDMxNTk4YzcwMmRkZTJiYmNjNDkyMTYyYjAwZDg.-hgv">
   Roundworms range in length from less than 1 millimeter to over 7 meters (23 feet) in length. As their name suggests, they have a round body. This is because they have a pseudocoelom. This is one way they differ from flatworms. Another way is their complete digestive system. It allows them to take in food, digest food, and eliminate wastes all at the same time.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-YmI0ZGVhNGRiNDdmZDU2MDA3Y2UxYTljMGQ0NDIwNzA.-lze">
   Roundworms have a tough covering of cuticle on the surface of their body. It prevents their body from expanding. This allows the buildup of fluid pressure in the pseudocoelom. As a result, roundworms have a hydrostatic skeleton. This provides a counterforce for the contraction of muscles lining the pseudocoelom. This allows the worms to move efficiently along solid surfaces.

   Roundworms reproduce sexually. Sperm and eggs are produced by separate male and female adults. Fertilization takes place inside the female organism. Females lay huge numbers of eggs, sometimes as many as 100,000 per day! The eggs hatch into larvae, which develop into adults. Then the cycle repeats.

They migrate to the intestine, where they mature into adults. Adults lay eggs, which pass out of the host in feces. Then the cycle repeats.

   Tiny pinworms are the most common roundworm parasites of people in the U.S. In some areas, as many as one out of three children are infected. Humans become infected when they ingest the nearly microscopic pinworm eggs. The eggs hatch and develop into adults in the host&#8217;s digestive tract. Adults lay eggs that pass out of the host&#8217;s body to continue the cycle. Pinworms have a fairly simple life cycle with only one host.

   Structure and Function of Mollusks

   Mollusks are a very diverse phylum. Some mollusks are nearly microscopic. The largest mollusk, a colossal squid, may be as long as a school bus and weigh over half a ton! The basic body plan of a mollusk is shown in

   . The main distinguishing feature is a hard outer shell. It covers the top of the body and encloses the internal organs. Most mollusks have a distinct head region. The head may have tentacles for sensing the environment and grasping food. There is generally a muscular foot, which may be used for walking. However, the foot has evolved modifications in many species to be used for other purposes.

   Two unique features of mollusks are the mantle and radula (see

   ). The
   <strong>
    mantle
   </strong>
   is a layer of tissue that lies between the shell and the body. It secretes calcium carbonate to form the shell. It forms a cavity, called the mantle cavity, between the mantle and the body. The mantle cavity pumps water for filter feeding. The radula is a feeding organ with teeth made of chitin. It is located in front of the mouth in the head region. Herbivorous mollusks use the radula to scrape food such as algae off rocks. Predatory mollusks use the radula to drill holes in the shells of their prey.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-YmNkNDMxYTNjOTM0MjY1MTU5ZDMwYjJlZThiYzA0YTk.-bs2">
   Mollusks have a coelom and a complete digestive system. Their excretory system consists of tube-shaped organs called nephridia (see
   <strong>

   </strong>
   <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTE1LW1vbGx1c2stYm9keS1wbGFu">

   ). The organs filter waste from body fluids and release the waste into the coelom. Terrestrial mollusks exchange gases with the surrounding air. This occurs across the lining of the mantle cavity. Aquatic mollusks &#8220;breathe&#8221; under water with gills.
   <strong>
    Gills
   </strong>
   are thin filaments that absorb gases and exchange them between the blood and surrounding water. Mollusks have a circulatory system with one or two hearts that pump blood. The
   <strong>
    heart
   </strong>
   is a muscular organ that pumps blood through the circulatory system when its muscles contract. The circulatory system may be open or closed, depending on the species.

   Mollusks reproduce sexually. Most species have separate male and female sexes. Gametes are released into the mantle cavity. Fertilization may be internal or external, depending on the species. Fertilized eggs develop into larvae. There may be one or more larval stages. Each one is different from the adult stage. Mollusks (and annelids) have a unique larval form called a trochophore. It is a tiny organism with cilia for swimming.

   Mollusks live in most terrestrial, freshwater, and marine habitats. However, the majority of species live in the ocean. They can be found in both shallow and deep water and from tropical to polar latitudes. Mollusks are a major food source for other organisms, including humans. You may have eaten mollusks such as clams, oysters, scallops, or mussels. The different classes of mollusks have different ways of obtaining food.

   <li>
    Gastropods are may be herbivores, predators, or internal parasites. They live in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Marine species live mainly in shallow coastal waters. Gastropods use their foot to crawl slowly over rocks, reefs, or soil, looking for food.
   </li>
   <li>
    Bivalves are generally sessile filter feeders. They live in both freshwater and marine habitats. They use their foot to attach themselves to rocks or reefs or to burrow into mud. Bivalves feed on plankton and nonliving organic matter. They filter the food out of the water as it flows through their mantle cavity.
   </li>
   <li>
    Cephalopods are carnivores that live only in marine habitats. They may be found in the open ocean or close to shore. They are either predators or scavengers. They generally eat other invertebrates and fish.

   What's the coolest critter in the ocean under 4 inches long? The Dwarf Cuttlefish! Cuttlefish are marine animals that belong to the class Cephalopoda. Despite their name, cuttlefish are not fish but molluscs. Recent studies indicate that cuttlefish are among the most intelligent invertebrates, with one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates. Cuttlefish have an internal shell called the cuttlebone and eight arms and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers, with which they secure their prey.

   KQED: The Fierce Humboldt Squid
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-Yzc5ZjgxNWFkMTk3OTBiN2Q0ZGQyODYzZTlkNjM3NmM.-dt4">
   The Humboldt squid is a large, predatory invertebrate found in the waters of the Pacific Ocean. A mysterious sea creature up to 7 feet long, with 10 arms, a sharp beak and a ravenous appetite, packs of fierce Humboldt Squid attack nearly everything they see, from fish to scuba divers. Traveling in groups of 1,000 or more and swimming at speeds of more than 15 miles an hour, these animals hunt and feed together, and use jet propulsion to shoot out of the water to escape predators. Humboldt squid live at depths of between 600 and about 2,000 feet, coming to the surface at night to feed. They live for approximately two years and spend much of their short life in the ocean's oxygen-minimum zone, where very little other life exists. Because they live at such depths, little is known about these mysterious sea creatures. The Humboldt squid usually lives in the waters of the Humboldt Current, ranging from the southern tip of South America north to California, but in recent years, this squid has been found as far north as Alaska. Marine biologists are working to discover why they have headed north from their traditional homes off South America. See

  <p id="x-ck12-MWZmNjJjZTU1MTM4NGVmMDExNGI4ZmQ4YTk0NTUwODc.-g3v">
   Annelids range in length from less than 1 millimeter to over 3 meters. They never attain the large size of some mollusks. Like mollusks, however, they have a coelom. In fact, the annelid coelom is even larger, allowing greater development of internal organs. Annelids have other similarities with mollusks, including:
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-NjAwMGQ4Zjc1YzYxYmVkMjdmNmU5ZTVjYjBmZThlMDU.-i5y">
   <li>
    A closed circulatory system (like cephalopods).
   </li>
   <li>
    An excretory system consisting of tubular nephridia.
   </li>
   <li>
    A complete digestive system.
   </li>
   <li>
    A brain.
   </li>
   <li>
    Sensory organs for detecting light and other stimuli.
   </li>
   <li>
    Gills for gas exchange (but many exchange gas through their skin).
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p id="x-ck12-YzliOTlmNjhmNDdhMzEyYTliNzY0YzIwZjAwM2E5YTI.-lcv">
   The segmentation of annelids is highly adaptive. For one thing, it allows more efficient movement. Each segment generally has its own nerve and muscle tissues. Thus, localized muscle contractions can move just those segments needed for a particular motion. Segmentation also allows an animal to have specialized segments to carry out particular functions. This allows the whole animal to be more efficient. Annelids have the amazing capacity to regrow segments that break off. This is called
   <strong>
    regeneration.

   <li>
    In some species, the same individual produces both sperm and eggs. But worms mate to exchange sperm, rather than self-fertilizing their own eggs. Fertilized eggs are deposited in a mucous cocoon. Offspring emerge from the cocoon looking like small adults. They grow to adult size without going through a larval stage.
   </li>
   <li>
    In polychaete species, there are separate sexes. Adult worms go through a major transformation to develop reproductive organs. This occurs in many adults at once. Then they all swim to the surface and release their gametes in the water, where fertilization takes place. Offspring go through a larval stage before developing into adults.

   Structure and Function of Arthropods

  <p id="x-ck12-YjUwYjcwY2RmNmJjOGU4YjRkYTI3YzY3YjQ5MjM4Nzc.-owr">
   Arthropods range in length from about 1 millimeter to 4 meters (about 13 feet). They have a segmented body with a hard exoskeleton. They also have jointed appendages. The body segments are the head, thorax, and abdomen (see

   The arthropod exoskeleton consists of several layers of cuticle. The exoskeleton prevents water loss and gives support and protection. It also acts as a counterforce for the contraction of muscles. The exoskeleton doesn&#8217;t grow as the animal grows. Therefore, it must be shed and replaced with a new one periodically through life. This is called
   <strong>
    molting
   </strong>
   . The jointed appendages of arthropods may be used as legs for walking. Being jointed makes them more flexible. Try walking or climbing stairs without bending your knees, and you&#8217;ll see why joints are helpful. In most arthropods, the appendages on the head have been modified for other functions.

   Underwater Spiders
  </h4>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZDhkNjI4YWViOTk2MGNiNDUzZjdjNzNmNjFjMDczYmM.-nrt">
   In the ponds of northern Europe lives a tiny brown spider that spends its entire life underwater. But just like land spiders, it needs oxygen to breathe. So, how does this spider breath? Does it use book lungs? No. In fact, aquatic spiders, known as
   <em>
    diving bell spiders
   </em>
   , have gills, and every so often, the spider leaves its underwater web to visit the surface and bring back a bubble of air that sticks to its hairy abdomen. It deposits the bubble into a little silk air tank. This
   <em>
    diving bell
   </em>
   is a gill that sucks oxygen from the water, allowing the spider to stay underwater for up to 24 hours. See

   Arthropod Reproduction
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MTQxNTA0YzYyZDQ5NjYzNTFlODhjNTJhNmE4YTRlY2E.-x5z">
   Arthropods have a life cycle with sexual reproduction. Most species go through larval stages after hatching. The larvae are very different from the adults. They change into the adult form in a process called
   <strong>
    metamorphosis
   </strong>
   . This may take place within a cocoon. A familiar example of metamorphosis is the transformation of a caterpillar (larva) into a butterfly (adult). Other arthropod species, in contrast, hatch young that look like small adults. These species lack both larval stages and metamorphosis.

   Arthropods were the first animals to live on land. The earliest terrestrial arthropods were probably millipedes. They moved to land about 430 million years ago. Early land arthropods evolved adaptations such as book lungs or trachea to breathe air. The exoskeleton was another important adaptation. It prevents an animal from drying out. It also provides support in the absence of buoyant water.

   Insects range in length from less than a millimeter to about the length of your arm. They can be found in most habitats, but they are mainly terrestrial. Many can fly, so they are also aerial. Like other arthropods, insects have a head, thorax, and abdomen. They have a wide variety of appendages, including six legs attached to the thorax. Insects have a pair of antennae for &#8220;smelling&#8221; and &#8220;tasting&#8221; chemicals. Some insects can also use their antennae to detect sound. Other sensory organs on the head include several simple eyes and a pair of compound eyes. The compound eyes let insects see images. Butterflies and bees can even see in color. For feeding, the head contains one pair of mandibles and two pairs of maxillae. Insects consume a wide range of foods, and their mouthparts have become specialized. Several variations are shown in

   Insect Flight
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NzdjMjFkNDhjOTczODYyYzlmY2JiNTE0MmMxNDQ3Yjc.-z3l">
   The main reason that insects have been so successful is their ability to fly. Insects are the only invertebrates that can fly and the first animals to evolve flight. Flight has important advantages. It&#8217;s a guaranteed means of escape from nonflying predators. It also aids in the search for food and mates. Insects generally have two pairs of wings for flight. Wings are part of the exoskeleton and attached to the thorax. Insect wings show a lot of variation. As you can see in

   , butterfly wings are paper-thin, whereas beetle wings are like armor. Not all insect wings work the same way, either. They differ in how the muscles are attached and whether the two pairs of wings work independently or together. Besides flight, wings serve other functions. They may protect the body (beetles), communicate visually with other insects (butterflies), or produce sounds to attract mates (katydids).

   When an insect egg hatches, a larva emerges. The larva eats and grows and then enters the pupa stage. The
   <strong>
    pupa
   </strong>
   is immobile and may be encased in a cocoon. During the pupa stage, the insect goes through metamorphosis. Tissues and appendages of the larva break down and reorganize into the adult form. How did such an incredible transformation evolve? Metamorphosis is actually very advantageous. It allows functions to be divided between life stages. Each stage can evolve adaptations to suit it for its specific functions without affecting the adaptations of the other stage.

   Insect Behavior
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MzEyMmEyNzQ3NzY5ZDhjZjM2NTE1YTE0YWNjZjhlZWU.-vis">
   Insects are capable of a surprising range of behaviors. Most of their behaviors, such as flying and mating, are instinctive. These are behaviors that don&#8217;t need to be learned. They are largely controlled by genes. However, some insect behaviors are learned. For example, ants and bees can learn where food is located and keep going back for more.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-N2UyNjljZmUyM2VjZDI2NDZlYTYyZTQyODYxYTA0N2M.-bfw">
   Many species of insects have evolved complex social behaviors. They live together in large, organized colonies (see

   ). This is true of ants, termites, bees, and wasps. Colonies may include millions of individual insects. Colony members divide up the labor of the colony. Different insects are specialized for different jobs. Some reproduce, while others care for the young. Still others get food or defend the nest.

  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-YzAxODY1ZmQ1YmEyNzY5YTVjZjM4ODUxODc2MmI1MGQ.-yk7">
   Ladybugs, also known as ladybird beetles, have a life cycle of four to six weeks. In one year as many as six generations of ladybird beetles may hatch. In the spring, each adult female lays up to 300 eggs in small clusters on plants where aphids are present. After a week the wingless larvae hatch. Both the ladybird beetle larvae and adults are active predators, eating only aphids, scales, mites and other plant-eating insects. The ladybugs live on the vegetation where their prey is found, which includes roses, oleander, milkweed and broccoli. Adult ladybugs don&#8217;t taste very good. A bird careless enough to try to eat one will not swallow it.

  <p id="x-ck12-ZTQ3ODVmYzg1OTdhMGJmZGE5OWM4YzI4MjA4MTIxOTk.-v8o">
   By late May to early June, when the larvae have depleted the food supply, the adults migrate to the mountains. There, they eat mainly pollen. The ladybugs gain fat from eating the pollen and this tides them over their nine-month hibernation. Thousands of adults hibernate overwinter in tight clusters, called aggregates, under fallen leaves and ground litter near streams. In the clear, warmer days of early spring, the ladybugs break up the aggregates and begin several days of mating. Learn about ladybugs at

   Most humans interact with insects every day. Many of these interactions are harmless and often go unnoticed. However, insects cause humans a lot of harm. They spread human diseases. For example, the deadly bubonic plague of the middle ages was spread by fleas. Today, millions of people die each year from malaria, which is spread by mosquitoes. Insects also eat our crops. Sometimes they travel in huge swarms that completely strip the land of all plant material (see

  <p id="x-ck12-NWY1MjIzOTEzZmEwOWJiMzIyNTEzY2NkYThiM2IwYTc.-5fd">
   Honeybees are one of the most well-known insects on the planet. Bees are naturalized on every continent except Antarctica. Honeybees have a highly developed social structure and depend on their community, or colony, for survival, with a colony containing up to 20,000 bees. When bees search plants for nectar, pollen sticks to the fuzzy hairs that cover their hind legs. At the next flower, some of the pollen rubs off and fertilizes that flower. In this way, bees help improve fruit production. Bees pollinate an estimated 130 different varieties of fruit, flowers, nuts and vegetables in the United States alone. Farmers obviously depend on bees to pollinate crops, such as fruit and nuts, but in recent years thousands of bee colonies have disappeared. This could be a devastating issue for farmers. Can anything be done? Meet two Northern California researchers looking for ways to make sure we always have bees to pollinate our crops at

   <li>
    Arthropods are the largest phylum in the animal kingdom. Most arthropods are insects. The phylum also includes spiders, centipedes, and crustaceans. The arthropod body consists of three segments with a hard exoskeleton and jointed appendages. Terrestrial arthropods have adaptations for life on land, such as trachea or book lungs for breathing air. The earliest arthropods were trilobites. The earliest land arthropods were millipedes.
   </li>
   <li>
    Insects are arthropods in the class Hexapoda. They are the most numerous organisms in the world. Most are terrestrial, and many are aerial. Insects have six legs and a pair of antennae for sensing chemicals. They also have several eyes and specialized mouthparts for feeding. Insects are the only invertebrates than can fly. Flight is the main reason for their success. Insects may live in large colonies and have complex social behaviors. Insects spread disease and destroy crops. However, they are essential for pollinating flowering plants.

   A unique feature of echinoderms is their water vascular system. This is a network of canals that extend along each body part. In most echinoderms, the canals have external projections called tube feet (see

   ). The feet have suckers on the ends. Muscle contractions force water into the feet, causing them to extend outward. As the feet extend, they attach their suckers to new locations, farther away from their previous points of attachment. This results in a slow but powerful form of movement. The suckers are very strong. They can even be used to pry open the shells of prey.

   Echinoderms lack respiratory and excretory systems. Instead, the thin walls of their tube feet allow oxygen to diffuse in and wastes to diffuse out. Echinoderms also lack a centralized nervous system. They have an open circulatory system and lack a heart. On the other hand, echinoderms have a well-developed coelom and a complete digestive system. Echinoderms use pheromones to communicate with each other. They detect the chemicals with sensory cells on their body surface. Some echinoderms also have simple eyes (ocelli) that can sense light. Like annelids, echinoderms have the ability to regenerate a missing body part.

   Echinoderm Reproduction
  </h3>

   Some echinoderms can reproduce asexually by fission, but most echinoderms reproduce sexually. They generally have separate sexes and external fertilization. Eggs hatch into free-swimming larvae. The larvae undergo metamorphosis to change into the adult form. During metamorphosis, their bilateral symmetry changes to radial symmetry.

   <li>
    Notochord: The notochord lies between the dorsal nerve cord and the digestive tract. It provides stiffness to counterbalance the pull of muscles.
