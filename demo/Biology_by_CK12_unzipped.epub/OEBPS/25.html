    This image depicts a true wonder of nature. This tiny human sperm is penetrating a much larger egg. These two cells will unite to become a brand new human being. The process in which they unite is called fertilization. Do you know how sperm and egg cells are produced? When and where do they form? Do you know what will happen to the egg and sperm after they unite? How will the fertilized egg develop into a complete and very complex human being? You&#8217;ll find answers to all of these questions when you read this chapter.

   The
   <strong>
    reproductive system
   </strong>
   in both males and females consists of structures that produce reproductive cells, or gametes, and secrete sex hormones. A gamete is a haploid cell that combines with another haploid gamete during fertilization.
   <strong>
    Sex hormones
   </strong>
   are chemical messengers that control sexual development and reproduction. The male reproductive system consists of structures that produce male gametes called sperm and secrete the male sex hormone
   <strong>
    testosterone.

   Penis
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZWJhYzNlNzNlODZmNGJjNjQ2ODI1YmEzZjMwZGZjMzA.-oqg">
   The
   <strong>
    penis
   </strong>
   is an external genital organ with a long shaft and enlarged tip called the glans penis. The shaft of the penis contains erectile tissues that can fill with blood and cause an erection. When this occurs, the penis gets bigger and stiffer. The urethra passes through the penis. Sperm pass out of the body through the urethra. (During urination, the urethra carries urine from the bladder.)
  </p>
  <h3 id="x-ck12-VGVzdGVz-frp">
   Testes
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-Yzg4MjUyMWU1MTMzYWQzNWEwNmJlNDgxYmY1NzUyZTk.-wn5">
   The two
   <strong>
    testes
   </strong>
   (singular, testis) are located below the penis. They hang between the thighs in a sac of skin called the scrotum. Each testis contains more than 30 meters (90 feet) of tiny, tightly packed tubules called seminiferous tubules. These tubules are the functional units of the testes. They produce sperm and secrete testosterone.
  </p>
  <h3 id="x-ck12-RXBpZGlkeW1pcw..-ogl">
   Epididymis
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-M2RiOTZlNTIxZjFlOGZjZjdkODNjYmViYzY0Y2M2ZmI.-hyk">
   The seminiferous tubules within each testis join to form the epididymis. The
   <strong>
    epididymis
   </strong>
   (plural, epididymes) is a coiled tube about 6 meters (20 feet) long lying atop the testis inside the scrotum. The functions of the epididymis are to mature and store mature sperm until they leave the body.
  </p>
  <h3 id="x-ck12-RHVjdHMgYW5kIEdsYW5kcw..-gfa">
   Ducts and Glands
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ODc2YTQzNTI5NmM1ZDFiNDJlYWM4MWZlNmUwZDg4OWE.-3k8">
   In addition to these organs, the male reproductive system consists of a series of ducts and glands. Ducts include the vas deferens and ejaculatory ducts. They transport sperm from the epididymes to the urethra in the penis. Glands include the seminal vesicles and prostate gland. They secrete substances that become part of semen.
  </p>
  <h3 id="x-ck12-U2VtZW4.-u9w">

  <p id="x-ck12-YzNkM2JiNDI3NmZhOTFhMDE3NDlkMzNkZmM4MjVlNTI.-owj">
   <strong>
    Semen
   </strong>
   is the fluid that carries sperm through the urethra and out of the body. In addition to sperm, it contains secretions from the glands. The secretions control pH and provide sperm with nutrients for energy.

   Sexual Development in Males
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-MzY5MGFkZjBhNmY4Y2QxMzcxY2RiOTJmZTMzZGNhODA.-s9z">
   The only obvious difference between boys and girls at birth is their reproductive organs. However, even the reproductive organs start out the same in both sexes.

   Development Before Birth
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NjQyODUxZGViZGRlM2M5N2MxMWE5M2ZhN2VmODZmODQ.-ynb">
   In the first several weeks after fertilization, males and females are essentially the same except for their chromosomes. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), and males have an X and a Y chromosome (XY). Then, during the second month after fertilization, genes on the Y chromosome of males cause the secretion of testosterone. Testosterone stimulates the reproductive organs to develop into male organs. (Without testosterone, the reproductive organs always develop into female organs.) Although boys have male reproductive organs at birth, the organs are immature and not yet able to produce sperm or secrete testosterone.

   Puberty and Its Changes
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZmI3MTM0MzViOGViN2UxN2U5MzM1NmU4YTBmMGZhODM.-qa2">
   The reproductive organs grow very slowly during childhood and do not mature until puberty.
   <strong>
    Puberty
   </strong>
   is the period during which humans become sexually mature. In the U.S., boys generally begin puberty at about age 12 and complete it at about age 18. What causes puberty to begin? The hypothalamus in the brain &#8220;tells&#8221; the pituitary gland to secrete hormones that target the testes. The main pituitary hormone involved is
   <strong>
    luteinizing hormone (LH).
   </strong>
   It stimulates the testes to secrete testosterone. Testosterone, in turn, promotes protein synthesis and growth. It brings about most of the physical changes of puberty, some of which are shown in
   <strong>

   Adolescent Growth Spurt
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-Mzg0Yjk4N2ZiYWM1ODUzNTM5OTQ5OTU1YTQwZjcwYjY.-oqe">
   Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth. This is called the
   <strong>
    adolescent growth spurt.
   </strong>
   In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished.

   Spermatogenesis
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MDE4MjUzNjUzZTlmOTk3ZWI1MGM5NDQxNmY1YzgxYjQ.-lxs">
   The process of producing mature sperm is called
   <strong>
    spermatogenesis.
   </strong>
   Sperm are produced in the seminiferous tubules of the testes and become mature in the epididymis. The entire process takes about 9 to 10 weeks. You can watch an animation of spermatogenesis at this link:

   Spermatogonia lining the seminiferous tubule undergo mitosis to form primary spermatocytes, which are also diploid. The primary spermatocytes undergo the first meiotic division to form secondary spermatocytes, which are haploid. Spermatocytes make up the next layer of cells inside the seminiferous tubule. Finally, the secondary spermatocytes complete meiosis to form spermatids. Spermatids make up a third layer of cells in the tubule.

   . The spermatids grow a tail and lose excess cytoplasm from the head. When a sperm is mature, the tail can rotate like a propeller, so the sperm can propel itself forward. Mitochondria in the connecting piece produce the energy needed for movement. The head of the mature sperm consists mainly of the nucleus, which carries copies of the father&#8217;s chromosomes. The part of the head called the acrosome produces enzymes that help the head penetrate an egg.

   The female reproductive system consists of structures that produce female gametes called eggs and secrete the female sex hormone
   <strong>
    estrogen.
   </strong>
   The female reproductive system has several other functions as well:

   External Structures
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-YTcxOGM3Yjc5NTM1ZjdmZThmMTQxZjVkNTJiYzgyOWY.-stj">
   The external female reproductive structures are referred to collectively as the
   <strong>
    vulva.
   </strong>
   They include the labia (singular, labium), which are the &#8220;lips&#8221; of the vulva. The labia protect the vagina and urethra, both of which have openings in the vulva.
  </p>
  <h3 id="x-ck12-VmFnaW5h_1-pvh">
   Vagina
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZTgwNTJmZjA4OWM2ZDI2ZWY3ZjYwNjAxZDI4ZWJhYzc.-evs">
   The vagina is a tube-like structure about 9 centimeters (3.5 inches) long. It begins at the vulva and extends upward to the uterus. It has muscular walls lined with mucous membranes. The vagina has two major reproductive functions. It receives sperm during sexual intercourse, and it provides a passageway for a baby to leave the mother&#8217;s body during birth.
  </p>
  <h3 id="x-ck12-VXRlcnVz_1-oue">
   Uterus
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZTZmN2VlZmZjMzNmMmQyNjdiZDUwYjNjYTYxZmNlMzk.-pli">
   The uterus is a muscular organ shaped like an upside-down pear. It has a thick lining of tissues called the endometrium. The lower, narrower end of the uterus is known as the cervix. The uterus is where a fetus grows and develops until birth. During pregnancy, the uterus can expand greatly to make room for the baby as it grows. During birth, contractions of the muscular walls of the uterus push the baby through the cervix and out of the body.
  </p>
  <h3 id="x-ck12-T3Zhcmllcw.._1-d0c">
   Ovaries
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MzA5NjFiYThkMzM4ZjkxOWRkZjlkOTAwNWRhOTQwYzY.-8tm">
   The two ovaries are small, egg-shaped organs that lie on either side of the uterus. They produce eggs and secrete estrogen. Each egg is located inside a structure called a follicle. Cells in the follicle protect the egg and help it mature.
  </p>
  <h3 id="x-ck12-RmFsbG9waWFuIFR1YmVz_1-p1t">
   Fallopian Tubes
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-YmQzNTA0YjAzZDRlNWM4MWVlZjUwZDUzODc5MmQyZDQ.-2xu">
   Extending from the upper corners of the uterus are the two
   <strong>
    fallopian tubes.
   </strong>
   Each tube reaches (but is not attached to) one of the ovaries. The ovary end of the tube has a fringelike structure that moves in waves. The motion sweeps eggs from the ovary into the tube.
  </p>
  <h3 id="x-ck12-QnJlYXN0cw.._1-xwc">
   Breasts
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ODFhODhlZmU2ZDhiM2M4N2ZlNzFiYThlY2E1NTIwMTM.-vay">
   The breasts are not directly involved in reproduction, but they nourish a baby after birth. Each breast contains mammary glands, which secrete milk. The milk drains into ducts leading to the nipple. A suckling baby squeezes the milk out of the ducts and through the nipple.

   Sexual Development in Females
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-OGJmZTAyODllZjQ5N2RkYmI5MzIzODc4ZTZkMTgxZjA.-o1i">
   Female reproductive organs form before birth. However, as in males, the organs do not mature until puberty.

   Development Before Birth
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-YzI5OGEyODExY2ZkZTllNmJjMDI2YzVlNjc0OWY0OGM.-wjl">
   Unlike males, females are not influenced by the male sex hormone testosterone during embryonic development. This is because they lack a Y chromosome. As a result, females do not develop male reproductive organs. By the third month of fetal development, most of the internal female organs have formed. Immature eggs also form in the ovary before birth. Whereas a mature male produces sperm throughout his life, a female produces all the eggs she will ever make before birth.
  </p>

   Changes of Puberty
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-YjgxODdjYTM2MGM0NzMyYWE1YWFlZWUxY2Y0ZjE0NTE.-uzg">
   Like baby boys, baby girls are born with all their reproductive organs present but immature and unable to function. Female reproductive organs also grow very little until puberty. Girls begin puberty a year or two earlier than boys, at an average age of 10 years. Girls also complete puberty sooner than boys, in about 4 years instead of 6. Puberty in girls starts when the hypothalamus &#8220;tells&#8221; the pituitary gland to secrete hormones that target the ovaries. Two pituitary hormones are involved: luteinizing hormone (LH) and
   <strong>
    follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).
   </strong>
   These hormones stimulate the ovary to produce estrogen. Estrogen, in turn, promotes growth and other physical changes of puberty. It stimulates growth and development of the internal reproductive organs, breasts, and pubic hair (see

   Adolescent Growth Spurt
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZjlhOTNmNjkzYjJlOTMzYjc1ZjgyNzhjOTA5MDc5NDk.-tps">
   Like boys, girls also go through an adolescent growth spurt. However, girls typically start their growth spurt a year or two earlier than boys (and therefore a couple of centimeters shorter, on average). Girls also have a shorter growth spurt. For example, they typically reach their adult height by about age 15. In addition, girls generally do not grow as fast as boys do during the growth spurt, even at their peak rate of growth. As a result, females are about 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) shorter, on average, than males by the time they reach their final height.

   Menarche
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-OWRiYzdmY2Y4NmNkYTNmM2QzMmI5MjYxZjdhMTAyN2E.-p9o">
   One of the most significant changes in females during puberty is menarche.
   <strong>
    Menarche
   </strong>
   is the beginning of menstruation, or monthly periods. In U.S. girls, the average age of menarche is 12.5 years, although there is a lot of variation in this age. The variation may be due to a combination of genetic factors and environmental factors, such as diet.

   Egg Production
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-MGFiMzI2NzQ3YjZiYzdiNjQ5MjU4OTRlNGM5MmMwMzE.-nte">
   At birth, a female&#8217;s ovaries contain all the eggs she will ever produce. However, the eggs do not start to mature until she enters puberty. After menarche, one egg typically matures each month until a woman reaches middle adulthood.

  <h3 id="x-ck12-T29nZW5lc2lz_1-4u0">
   Oogenesis
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MGNlZmYyZTQzNjYzNDllOGEyZjg3NjQwNDYwZmNjYmM.-pcz">
   The process of producing eggs in the ovary is called
   <strong>
    oogenesis.
   </strong>
   Eggs, like sperm, are haploid cells, and their production occurs in several steps that involve different types of cells, as shown in

   Oogenesis begins long before birth when an oogonium with the diploid number of chromosomes undergoes mitosis. It produces a diploid daughter cell called a primary oocyte. The primary oocyte, in turn, starts to go through the first cell division of meiosis (meiosis I). However, it does not complete meiosis until much later. The primary oocyte remains in a resting state, nestled in a tiny, immature follicle until puberty.

   If the egg is fertilized, the endometrium will be maintained and help nourish the egg. The ruptured follicle, now called the corpus luteum, will secrete the hormone progesterone. This hormone keeps the endometrium from breaking down. If the egg is not fertilized, the corpus luteum will break down and disappear. Without progesterone, the endometrium will also break down and be shed. A new menstrual cycle thus begins.

   Menopause
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NTc4ZWY1OWMwN2YxNDhkMWE2YzVmYzBjOWY1NTgwZDA.-4fz">
   For most women, menstrual cycles continue until their mid- to late forties. Then women go through
   <strong>
    menopause
   </strong>
   , a period during which their menstrual cycles slow down and eventually stop, generally by their early fifties. After menopause, women can no longer reproduce naturally because their ovaries no longer produce eggs.

  <ul id="x-ck12-ZDA3ZDIwMjViMGFmZGE3ZWFhZGQ4OTZjYmYwNjRhYTk.-eqv">
   <li>
    The female reproductive system consists of structures that produce eggs and secrete female sex hormones. They also provide a site for fertilization and enable the development and birth of a fetus. They include the vagina, uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes.
   </li>
   <li>
    Female reproductive organs form before birth. However, they do not mature until puberty.
   </li>
   <li>
    Immature eggs form in the ovaries before birth. Each month, starting in puberty, one egg matures and is released from the ovary. Release of an egg is called ovulation.
   </li>
   <li>
    The menstrual cycle includes events that take place in the ovary, such as ovulation. It also includes changes in the uterus, including menstruation. Menopause occurs when menstruation stops occurring, usually in middle adulthood.

   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZjA5MjI5YWQ5ZjE4MWQ0OGViYzA0ZTNhMmNkOWNiOWY.-wjo">
   A day or two after an ovary releases an egg, the egg may unite with a sperm. Sperm are deposited in the vagina during sexual intercourse. They propel themselves through the uterus and enter a fallopian tube. This is where fertilization usually takes place.

   Cleavage and Implantation
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-MzljYWQ0Zjc1NTJhOWYyYThiN2JmYzc2N2QxNDRhNjk.-c0v">
   When a sperm penetrates the egg, it triggers the egg to complete meiosis. The sperm also undergoes changes. Its tail falls off, and its nucleus fuses with the nucleus of the egg. The resulting cell, called a zygote, contains all the chromosomes needed for a new human organism. Half the chromosomes come from the egg and half from the sperm.

   Morula and Blastocyst Stages
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-YzcyZGVkZjA0MTFlMTE4ZWMwYjkzZDM4ZjMxZjcxMDE.-hyv">
   The zygote spends the next few days traveling down the fallopian tube toward the uterus, where it will take up residence. As it travels, it divides by mitosis several times to form a ball of cells called a morula. The cell divisions are called cleavage. They increase the number of cells but not the overall size of the new organism. As more cell divisions occur, a fluid-filled cavity forms inside the ball of cells. At this stage, the ball of cells is called a
   <strong>
    blastocyst.
   </strong>
   The cells of the blastocyst form an inner cell mass and an outer cell layer, as shown in
   <strong>

   </strong>
   <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTI1LTExLWJsYXN0b2N5c3Q.">

   . The inner cell mass is called the embryoblast. These cells will soon develop into an embryo. The outer cell layer is called the trophoblast. These cells will develop into other structures needed to support and nourish the embryo.

   The blastocyst continues down the fallopian tube and reaches the uterus about 4 or 5 days after fertilization. When the outer cells of the blastocyst contact cells of the endometrium lining the uterus, the blastocyst embeds in the endometrium. The process of embedding is called
   <strong>
    implantation.

   The placenta is a temporary organ that begins to form from the trophoblast layer of cells shortly after implantation. (For an animation showing how the placenta forms, go to link below.) The placenta continues to develop and grow to meet the needs of the growing fetus. A fully developed placenta, like the one in

   The pregnant mother plays a critical role in the development of the embryo and fetus. She must avoid toxic substances such as alcohol, which can damage the developing offspring. She must also provide all the nutrients and other substances needed for normal growth and development. Most nutrients are needed in greater amounts by a pregnant woman, but some are especially important, including folic acid (vitamin B9), calcium, iron, and omega-3 fatty acids.

   Childbirth
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MTY2NjUwNTlkZGI4MTQ2MDdiYTBhZjljZTA1ZTE2YWM.-zln">
   Near the time of birth, the amniotic sac breaks in a gush of fluid. Labor usually begins within a day of this event. Labor involves contractions of the muscular walls of the uterus, which cause the cervix to dilate. With the mother&#8217;s help, the contractions eventually push the fetus out of the uterus and through the vagina. Within seconds of birth, the umbilical cord is cut. Without this connection to the placenta, the baby cannot exchange gases, so carbon dioxide quickly builds up in the baby&#8217;s blood. This stimulates the brain to trigger breathing, and the newborn takes its first breath.

Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer&#8217;s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common.

  <ul id="x-ck12-OWU5ZmYwMDAxNTlkMzY3Mzg3ZTgxOWNhMjFhNDkzZGM.-8gh">
   <li>
    Fertilization is the union of a sperm and egg, resulting in the formation of a zygote. The zygote undergoes many cell divisions before it implants in the lining of the uterus.
   </li>
   <li>
    The embryonic stage begins with implantation. An embryo forms three distinct cell layers, and each layer develops into different types of cells and organs.
   </li>
   <li>
    The fetal stage begins about two months after fertilization and continues until birth. During this stage, organs continue to develop, and the fetus grows in size.
   </li>
   <li>
    The placenta allows nutrients and wastes to be exchanged between the mother and fetus. The fetus is connected to the placenta through the umbilical cord.
   </li>
   <li>
    A pregnant woman should avoid toxins and take in adequate nutrients for normal fetal growth and development. During childbirth, contractions of the uterus push the child out of the body.
   </li>
   <li>
    Growth and development are most rapid during infancy and slower throughout the rest of childhood until adolescence. Adolescence involves mental, emotional, and social changes in addition to the physical changes of puberty.
   </li>
   <li>
    During early adulthood, people form intimate relationships and start careers. Serious health problems start showing up in middle adulthood and old age. Aging occurs as cells lose their ability to divide.

    sexually transmitted infection (STI)
   </strong>
   (also known as a sexually transmitted disease, or STD) is an infection caused by a pathogen that spreads mainly through sexual contact. Worldwide, a million people a day become infected with STIs. The majority of them are under the age of 25. For a video about sexually transmitted infections, go to this link:

   Understanding Sexually Transmitted Infections
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-YjNlNWRiNWJkNWQwNGMxYThmZTllYTMxZDE1N2ExMDY.-5tq">
   To be considered an STI, an infection must have only a small chance of spreading naturally in ways other than sexual contact. Some infections that can spread through sexual contact, such as the common cold, spread more commonly by other means. These infections are not considered STIs.

   STIs may be caused by several different types of pathogens, including protozoa, insects, bacteria, and viruses. For example: Protozoa cause an STI called
   <strong>
    trichomoniasis.
   </strong>
   The pathogen infects the vagina in females and the urethra in males, causing symptoms such as burning and itching. Trichomoniasis is common in young people. Pubic lice, like the one in

   How STIs Spread
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MmFhMjgyM2JjOTQ0ZjVmYTQ1MzNlMDE5YzY5OTVhZmU.-b5n">
   Most of the pathogens that cause STIs enter the body through mucous membranes of the reproductive organs. All sexual behaviors that involve contact between mucous membranes put a person at risk for infection. This includes vaginal, anal, and oral sexual behaviors. Many STIs can also be transmitted through body fluids such as blood, semen, and breast milk. Therefore, behaviors such as sharing injection or tattoo needles is another way these STIs can spread. Why are STIs common in young people? One reason is that young people often take risks. They may think, &#8220;It can&#8217;t happen to me.&#8221; They also may not know how STIs are spread, so they don&#8217;t know how to protect themselves. In addition, young people may have multiple sexual partners.
  </p>
  <h3 id="x-ck12-UHJldmVudGluZyBTVElz_3-cer">
   Preventing STIs
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZDVhMjU1NDA1YjVhMzRkNmRmNmZmNDFhOTZlNmNjMDM.-r5n">
   The only completely effective way to prevent infection with STIs is to avoid sexual contact and other risky behaviors. Using condoms can lower the risk of becoming infected with STIs during some types of sexual activity. However, condoms are not foolproof. Pathogens may be present on areas of the body not covered by condoms. Condoms can also break or be used incorrectly.

   Symptoms of chlamydia may include a burning sensation during urination and a discharge from the vagina or penis. Chlamydia can be cured with antibiotics, but often there are no symptoms, so people do not seek treatment. Untreated chlamydia can lead to more serious problems, such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). This is an infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and/or ovaries. It can scar a woman&#8217;s reproductive organs and make it difficult for her to become pregnant. To learn more about chlamydia, watch the video at this link:

The sore is painless and heals on its own, so it may go unnoticed. If treated early, most cases of syphilis can be cured with antibiotics. Untreated syphilis can cause serious damage to the heart, brain, and other organs. It may eventually lead to death.
