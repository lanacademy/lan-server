    Do you know what these greenish, blob-like shapes are? Would it surprise you to learn that they are animals? They don&#8217;t look anything like the animals you are probably familiar with&#8212;animals such as dogs and deer, fish and frogs. But the greenish blobs are animals nonetheless. They belong to a phylum called Cnidaria, but you may know them as jellyfish. They are very simple animals and not fish at all. How can an organism as simple as a jellyfish be considered an animal? How are animals defined? What traits must an organism have to be classified in the animal kingdom? In this chapter, you will learn the answers to these questions. You will find out just what it means to be an animal.

   Characteristics of Animals

   <strong>
    Animals
   </strong>
   are a kingdom of multicellular eukaryotes. They cannot make their own food. Instead, they get nutrients by eating other living things. Therefore, animals are heterotrophs.

   ). Unlike the cells of plants and fungi, animal cells lack a cell wall. This gives animal cells flexibility. It lets them take on different shapes so they can become specialized to do particular jobs. The human nerve cell shown in

   Animals not only have specialized cells. Most animals also have tissues and organs. In many animals, organs form organ systems, such as a nervous system. Higher levels of organization allow animals to perform many complex functions. What can animals do that most other living things cannot? Here are some examples. All of them are illustrated in

   <li>
    Animals can detect environmental stimuli, such as light, sound, and touch. Stimuli are detected by sensory nerve cells. The information is transmitted and processed by the nervous system. The nervous system, in turn, may direct the body to respond.
   </li>
   <li>
    All animals can move, at least during some stage of their life cycle. Muscles and nerves work together to allow movement. Being able to move lets animals actively search for food and mates. It also helps them escape from predators.
   </li>
   <li>
    Virtually all animals have internal digestion of food. Animals consume other organisms and may use special tissues and organs to digest them. (Many other organisms absorb nutrients directly from the environment.)

   . Most animals spend the majority of their life as diploid organisms. Just about all animals reproduce sexually. Diploid adults undergo meiosis to produce sperm or eggs. Fertilization occurs when a sperm and an egg fuse. The zygote that forms develops into an embryo. The embryo eventually develops into an adult.

   Who were the ancestors of the earliest animals? They may have been marine protists that lived in colonies. Scientists think that cells of some protist colonies became specialized for different jobs. After a while, the specialized cells came to need each other for survival. Thus, the first multicellular animal evolved. Look at the cells in

   Moving from Water to Land

   When you think of the first animals to colonize the land, you may think of amphibians. It&#8217;s true that ancestors of amphibians were the first vertebrates to move to land. However, the very first animals to go ashore were invertebrates, most likely arthropods.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-OWY0ODkzM2JlMzg1ODNlZWZiNTE4MWU5ZDU2ODc2OGE.-a8y">
   The move to land required new adaptations. For example, animals needed a way to keep their body from drying out. They also needed a way to support their body on dry land without the buoyancy of water. One way early arthropods solved these problems was by evolving an

   This is a non-bony skeleton that forms on the outside of the body. It supports the body and helps retain water. The video

   Evolution of Chordates

  <p id="x-ck12-YmM3MGU3YzNiNTcyN2M0Nzc4ZDI5MDNlZDMxNzc1MGE.-qai">
   Another major step in animal evolution was the evolution of a notochord. A
   <strong>
    notochord
   </strong>
   is a rigid rod that runs the length of the body. It supports the body and gives it shape (see

   ). It also provides a place for muscles to anchor, and counterbalances them when they contract. Animals with a notochord are called chordates. They also have a hollow nerve cord that runs along the top of the body. Gill slits and a tail are two other chordate features. Many modern chordates have some of these structures only as embryos.

   Amphibians were the first animals to have true lungs and limbs for life on land. However, they still had to return to water to reproduce. That&#8217;s because their eggs lacked a waterproof covering and would dry out on land. The first fully terrestrial vertebrates were amniotes.

    Amniotes

   are animals that produce eggs with internal membranes. The membranes let gases but not water pass through. Therefore, in an amniotic egg, an embryo can breathe without drying out. Amniotic eggs were the first eggs that could be laid on land. The earliest amniotes evolved about 350 million years ago. They may have looked like the animal in

   Reproduction

   Most invertebrates reproduce sexually. Diploid adults produce haploid gametes (sperm and eggs). In some species, the same individuals produce both sperm and eggs. In other species, sperm and eggs are produced by separate male and female individuals. Fertilization occurs when a sperm and an egg fuse to form a diploid zygote. The zygote develops into an embryo and eventually into a new adult organism. On the way, it may pass through one or more larval stages. A
   <strong>
    larva
   </strong>
   (plural, larvae) is a juvenile, or immature, stage of an animal. It is generally quite different in form and function from the adult form of the species. For example, the larva may be able to swim freely, whereas the adult must remain permanently attached to a solid surface.

   Some invertebrates can also reproduce asexually. This may occur by fission or budding. Fission takes place when an animal simply divides into two parts. Each part then regrows the missing part. The result is two whole organisms. Budding may take place when a parent forms a small bump, or bud. The bud remains attached to the parent while it develops into a new individual.

   Invertebrate Evolution
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-ODlmNzdjMzQzODBjODIzZmQ0OGIwZjJjMjliNDRlYjg.-zdh">
   Invertebrates evolved several important traits before vertebrates even appeared. These traits are now found in just about all animals.
  </p>
  <h3 id="x-ck12-TXVsdGljZWxsdWxhcml0eQ.._1-oc6">
   Multicellularity
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MmY4MTkyOGJjYTNjOWU1NTg5YmUzYTRmZTY4OGQ2NTE.-kmr">
   The first animal trait to evolve was multicellularity. This was highly adaptive. Multiple cells could do different jobs. They could evolve special adaptations that allowed them to do their job really well. However, the first invertebrates still lacked tissues. Sponges represent the first organism at this stage of invertebrate evolution.
  </p>
  <h3 id="x-ck12-VGlzc3Vlcw.._1-cn3">
   Tissues
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NThhODBmMzRmOTBjZTcxMGUwYWYzMGJmZDg3ZWZlYWU.-dfx">
   Living cnidarians, such as jellyfish, represent the next stage of invertebrate evolution. This was the evolution of tissues. It was the first step in the evolution of organs and organ systems. At first, invertebrates developed tissues from just two embryonic cell layers. There was an outer cell layer called
   <strong>
    ectoderm
   </strong>
   and an inner cell layer called
   <strong>
    endoderm.
   </strong>
   The two cell layers allowed different types of tissues to form.

    radial symmetry.

   This was the first type of symmetry to evolve. The coral has a distinct top and bottom but not distinct ends. It can be divided into identical halves like a pie, but not into right and left halves. Animals with radial symmetry have no sense of directions such as forward and backward or left and right. This makes controlled movement in these directions impossible.

   Complete Digestive System
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZWMzMjAwN2MyOGNhYTQ5NTViZjZiN2QwZmY1ZDg1OTQ.-0hy">
   Early invertebrates had an incomplete digestive system. There was just one opening for the mouth and anus. Ancestors of modern roundworms were the first animals to evolve a complete digestive system. With a separate mouth and anus, food could move through the body in just one direction. This made digestion more efficient. An animal could keep eating while digesting food and getting rid of waste. Different parts of the digestive tract could also become specialized for different digestive functions. This led to the evolution of digestive organs.

   Ancestors of roundworms also evolved a
   <strong>
    pseudocoelom.
   </strong>
   This is a partial body cavity that is filled with fluid. It allows room for internal organs to develop. The fluid also cushions the internal organs. The pressure of the fluid within the cavity provides stiffness. It gives the body internal support, forming a
   <strong>
    hydrostatic skeleton.

   It explains why roundworms are round and flatworms are flat. Later, a true
   <strong>
    coelom

   <li>
    The majority of living animals are invertebrates. Invertebrates lack a backbone. They may have an incomplete or a complete digestive system. They vary in how they move and in the complexity of their nervous system. Most invertebrates reproduce sexually. After hatching, many invertebrates pass through one or more larval stages that are different from the adult stage.
   </li>

   This chapter presents an overview of invertebrate phyla. The next chapter describes invertebrate phyla in greater detail.
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-YTA4ZGI4NTQ4MWIwMzM4N2IyNzMxYTRkNWMzNzdjODI.-ndx">
   <li>
    What questions do you have about invertebrate phyla now? For example, do you wonder where organisms in the different phyla live or what they eat?
   </li>
   <li>
    Invertebrates evolved hundreds of millions of years ago. Which invertebrate phylum do you think has the greatest number of species today?
   </li>
