    These purple-flowered plants are not just pretty to look at. Plants like these led to a huge leap forward in biology. The plants are common garden peas, and they were studied in the mid-1800s by an Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel. With his careful experiments, Mendel uncovered the secrets of heredity, or how parents pass characteristics to their offspring. You may not care much about heredity in pea plants, but you probably care about your own heredity. Mendel's discoveries apply to you as well as to peas&#8212;and to all other living things that reproduce sexually. In this chapter, you will read about Mendel's experiments and the secrets of heredity that he discovered.

   Introduction

  <p id="x-ck12-OTYyMjJiMzdkZTJhYTA3ZDA2YTI1MDM5OTFlZDgxYzY.-lcy">
   People have long known that the characteristics of living things are similar in parents and their offspring. Whether it&#8217;s the flower color in pea plants or nose shape in people, it is obvious that offspring resemble their parents. However, it wasn&#8217;t until the experiments of Gregor Mendel that scientists understood how characteristics are inherited. Mendel's discoveries formed the basis of
   <strong>
    genetics
   </strong>
   , the science of heredity. That&#8217;s why Mendel is often called the &#8220;father of genetics.&#8221; It&#8217;s not common for a single researcher to have such an important impact on science. The importance of Mendel's work was due to three things: a curious mind, sound scientific methods, and good luck. You&#8217;ll see why when you read about Mendel's experiments.

   Mendel and His Pea Plants
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-YWNhYjU1NDllYTU3ZjljZDZmY2I4MDc4NmI1YzBlZmM.-kd3">
   Gregor Mendel was born in 1822 and grew up on his parents&#8217; farm in Austria. He did well in school and became a monk. He also went to the University of Vienna, where he studied science and math. His professors encouraged him to learn science through experimentation and to use math to make sense of his results. Mendel is best known for his experiments with the pea plant
   <em>
    Pisum sativum
   </em>
   (see

   Blending Theory of Inheritance
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-OGYyMGUwNzIyOWVmNDViYWJkNTJlMzgzMzI2MmQwMWI.-xqa">
   During Mendel's time, the blending theory of inheritance was popular. This is the theory that offspring have a blend, or mix, of the characteristics of their parents. Mendel noticed plants in his own garden that weren&#8217;t a blend of the parents. For example, a tall plant and a short plant had offspring that were either tall or short but not medium in height. Observations such as these led Mendel to question the blending theory. He wondered if there was a different underlying principle that could explain how characteristics are inherited. He decided to experiment with pea plants to find out. In fact, Mendel experimented with almost 30,000 pea plants over the next several years! At the following link, you can watch an animation in which Mendel explains how he arrived at his decision to study inheritance in pea plants:

   Why Study Pea Plants?
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-OWM3NmFlOTNkYThmMDA5OTA1NjIyN2VlNTllZGRmNmQ.-rfg">
   Why did Mendel choose common, garden-variety pea plants for his experiments? Pea plants are a good choice because they are fast growing and easy to raise. They also have several visible characteristics that may vary. These characteristics, which are shown in
   <strong>

   , include seed form and color, flower color, pod form and color, placement of pods and flowers on stems, and stem length. Each characteristic has two common values. For example, seed form may be round or wrinkled, and flower color may be white or purple (violet).

   Controlling Pollination
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-OTVmNDZjZDlmYWZmNzBhOGIzZjUxMzBhOGI2OWE4YmM.-ak5">
   To research how characteristics are passed from parents to offspring, Mendel needed to control pollination.
   <strong>
    Pollination
   </strong>
   is the fertilization step in the sexual reproduction of plants.
   <strong>
    Pollen
   </strong>
   consists of tiny grains that are the male gametes of plants. They are produced by a male flower part called the anther (see
   <strong>

   </strong>
   <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTA2LTAzLVBhcnRzLW9mLWEtZmxvd2Vy">

   </a>
   ). Pollination occurs when pollen is transferred from the anther to the stigma of the same or another flower. The stigma is a female part of a flower. It passes the pollen grains to female gametes in the ovary.

    Flowers are the reproductive organs of plants. Each pea plant flower has both male and female parts. The anther is part of the stamen, the male structure that produces male gametes (pollen). The stigma is part of the pistil, the female structure that produces female gametes and guides the pollen grains to them. The stigma receives the pollen grains and passes them to the ovary, which contains female gametes.
   </p>
  </div>
  <p id="x-ck12-NjY1MzhhMTAzY2U5ODYwNTliNjQyYjMxNTU2ODE4MjE.-bcp">
   Pea plants are naturally self-pollinating. In self-pollination, pollen grains from anthers on one plant are transferred to stigmas of flowers on the same plant. Mendel was interested in the offspring of two different parent plants, so he had to prevent self-pollination. He removed the anthers from the flowers of some of the plants in his experiments. Then he pollinated them by hand with pollen from other parent plants of his choice. When pollen from one plant fertilizes another plant of the same species, it is called cross-pollination. The offspring that result from such a cross are called
   <strong>
    hybrids.

   , all of the plants in the F1 generation had purple flowers. None of them had white flowers. Mendel wondered what had happened to the white-flower characteristic. He assumed some type of inherited factor produces white flowers and some other inherited factor produces purple flowers. Did the white-flower factor just disappear in the F1 generation? If so, then the offspring of the F1 generation&#8212;called the F2 generation&#8212;should all have purple flowers like their parents. To test this prediction, Mendel allowed the F1 generation plants to self-pollinate. He was surprised by the results. Some of the F2 generation plants had white flowers. He studied hundreds of F2 generation plants, and for every three purple-flowered plants, there was an average of one white-flowered plant.

And in each case, 75 percent of F2 plants had one value of the characteristic and 25 percent had the other value. Based on these observations, Mendel formulated his first law of inheritance. This law is called the
   <strong>
    law of segregation

   . It states that there are two factors controlling a given characteristic, one of which dominates the other, and these factors separate and go to different gametes when a parent reproduces.

   Mendel's Laws and Genetics
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-Yzc3NzE1MTU1ZjRjOTIzMzc1NjIzZmZlZjRmMTI1MTY.-kf9">
   You might think that Mendel's discoveries would have made a big impact on science as soon as he made them. But you would be wrong. Why? Because Mendel's work was largely ignored. Mendel was far ahead of his time and working from a remote monastery. He had no reputation among the scientific community and limited previously published work.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-NGM2YTRmNGY3NjQwODA4NzIzMDNmMDUwYjRkNTgxOGQ.-v6l">
   Mendel&#8217;s work, titled
   <em>
    Experiments in Plant Hybridization
   </em>
   , was published in 1866, and sent to prominent libraries in several countries, as well as 133 natural science associations. Mendel himself even sent carefully marked experiment kits to Karl von Nageli, the leading botanist of the day. The result - it was almost completely ignored. Von Nageli instead sent hawkweed seeds to Mendel, which he thought was a better plant for studying heredity. Unfortunately hawkweed reproduces asexually, resulting in genetically identical clones of the parent.

   Charles Darwin published his landmark book on evolution in 1869, not long after Mendel had discovered his laws. Unfortunately, Darwin knew nothing of Mendel's discoveries and didn&#8217;t understand heredity. This made his arguments about evolution less convincing to many people. This example demonstrates the importance for scientists to communicate the results of their investigations.

   Rediscovering Mendel's Work
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-YWY1YzNhYzdmNzlmZmEyZGI1YTgzYmZkNTk0NjIzYzg.-7va">
   Mendel's work was virtually unknown until 1900. Then, in that year, three different European scientists&#8212;named DeVries, Correns, and Tschermak&#8212;independently arrived at Mendel's laws. All three had done experiments similar to Mendel's. They came to the same conclusions that he had drawn almost half a century earlier. Only then was Mendel's actual work rediscovered. As scientists learned more about heredity over the next few decades, they were able to describe Mendel's ideas about inheritance in terms of genes. In this way, the field of genetics was born. At the link that follows, you can watch an animation of Mendel explaining his laws of inheritance in genetic terms.

   Genetics of Inheritance
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZGQwZWVhNzliZmZkMTc1YjhiMmNiZTZiY2VkZWE5NDM.-xoe">
   Today, we known that characteristics of organisms are controlled by genes on chromosomes (see

   ). The position of a gene on a chromosome is called its
   <strong>
    locus
   </strong>
   . In sexually reproducing organisms, each individual has two copies of the same gene. One copy comes from each parent. The gene for a characteristic may have different versions. The different versions are called
   <strong>
    alleles
   </strong>
   . For example, in pea plants, there is a purple-flower allele (B) and a white-flower allele (b). Different alleles account for much of the variation in the characteristics of organisms.

   During meiosis, homologous chromosomes separate and go to different gametes. Thus, the two alleles for each gene also go to different gametes. At the same time, different chromosomes assort independently. As a result, alleles for different genes assort independently as well. In these ways, alleles are shuffled and recombined in each parent&#8217;s gametes.

   Lesson Summary
  </h2>
  <ul id="x-ck12-ZDI5OWUxMTRhODNjMWQzNmRlYWNhNWQ4NzRmZDVmYzI.-i92">
   <li>
    Gregor Mendel experimented with pea plants to learn how characteristics are passed from parents to offspring.
   </li>
   <li>
    First, Mendel researched one characteristic at a time. This led to his law of segregation. This law states that each characteristic is controlled by two factors, which separate and go to different gametes when an organism reproduces.
   </li>
   <li>
    Then Mendel researched two characteristics at a time. This led to his law of independent assortment. This law states that the factors controlling different characteristics are inherited independently of each other.
   </li>
   <li>
    Mendel's work was rediscovered in 1900. Soon after that, genes and alleles were discovered. This allowed Mendel's laws to be stated in terms of the inheritance of alleles.

   Assume you are a plant breeder trying to develop a new variety of plant that is more useful to humans. You plan to cross-pollinate an insect-resistant plant with a plant that grows rapidly. Your goal is to produce a variety of plant that is both insect resistant and fast growing. What percent of the offspring would you expect to have both characteristics? Mendel's laws can be used to find out. However, to understand how Mendel's laws can be used in this way, you first need to know about probability.

   If you toss a coin twice, you might expect to get one head and one tail. But each time you toss the coin, the chance of a head is still 50 percent. Therefore, it&#8217;s quite likely that you will get two or even several heads (or tails) in a row. What if you tossed a coin ten times? You would probably get more or less than the expected five heads. For example, you might get seven heads (70 percent) and three tails (30 percent). The more times you toss the coin, however, the closer you will get to 50 percent heads. For example, if you tossed a coin 1000 times, you might get 510 heads and 490 tails.

   Probability and Fertilization

   Which of these gametes joins in fertilization with the gamete of another parent plant? This is a matter of chance, like tossing a coin. Thus, we can assume that either type of gamete&#8212;one with the
   <em>
    B
   </em>
   allele or one with the
   <em>
    b
   </em>
   allele&#8212;has an equal chance of uniting with any of the gametes produced by the other parent. Now assume that the other parent is also
   <em>
    Bb
   </em>
   . If gametes of two
   <em>
    Bb
   </em>
   parents unite, what is the chance of the offspring having one of each allele like the parents (
   <em>
    Bb
   </em>
   )? What is the chance of them having a different combination of alleles than the parents (either
   <em>
    BB
   </em>
   or
   <em>
    bb
   </em>
   )? To answer these questions, geneticists use a simple tool called a Punnett square.

   How Mendel Worked Backward to Get Ahead
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-NzdlYTA2Mjg1ZjA4YWNmMTNkMjI4NGQ4ZDk3MWI1MTM.-ggr">
   Mendel used hundreds or even thousands of pea plants in each experiment he did. Therefore, his results were very close to those you would expect based on the rules of probability. For example, in one of his first experiments with flower color, there were 929 plants in the F2 generation. Of these, 705 (76 percent) had purple flowers and 224 (24 percent) had white flowers. Thus, Mendel's results were very close to the 75 percent purple and 25 percent white you would expect by the laws of probability for this type of cross. Of course, Mendel had only phenotypes to work with. He knew nothing about genes and genotypes. Instead, he had to work backward from phenotypes and their percents in offspring to understand inheritance. From the results of his first set of experiments, Mendel realized that there must be two factors controlling each of the characteristics he studied, with one of the factors being dominant to the other. He also realized that the two factors separate and go to different gametes and later recombine in the offspring. This is an example of Mendel's good luck. All of the characteristics he studied happened to be inherited in this way. Mendel also was lucky when he did his second set of experiments. He happened to pick characteristics that are inherited independently of one another. We now know that these characteristics are controlled by genes on nonhomologous chromosomes. What if Mendel had studied characteristics controlled by genes on homologous chromosomes? Would they be inherited together? If so, how do you think this would have affected Mendel's conclusions? Would he have been able to develop his second law of inheritance? To better understand how Mendel interpreted his findings and developed his laws of inheritance, you can visit the following link. It provides an animation in which Mendel explains how he came to understand heredity from his experimental results.

   The inheritance of characteristics is not always as simple as it is for the characteristics that Mendel studied in pea plants. Each characteristic Mendel investigated was controlled by one gene that had two possible alleles, one of which was completely dominant to the other. This resulted in just two possible phenotypes for each characteristic. Each characteristic Mendel studied was also controlled by a gene on a different (nonhomologous) chromosome. As a result, each characteristic was inherited independently of the other characteristics. Geneticists now know that inheritance is often more complex than this.

   <li>
    A Punnett square is a chart for determining the expected percents of different genotypes and phenotypes in the offspring of two parents.
   </li>
   <li>
    Mendel used the percents of phenotypes in offspring to understand how characteristics are inherited.
   </li>
   <li>
    Many characteristics have more complex inheritance patterns than those studied by Mendel. They are complicated by factors such as codominance, incomplete dominance, multiple alleles, and environmental influences.

   Recall
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NzBlYjA4ZjIwY2M0YmMzNGE2NGZhMjBmNzU0NGUzMmE.-mpe">
   1. Define probability. Apply the term to a coin toss.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-YThhYTNlNDk1ZjZiYzVlMjJlNjJlY2ExMGZhNTgwMWY.-rmh">
   2. How is gamete formation like tossing a coin?
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-ODQzYWQ4ZmFjNTdiZTE4MTE3NjViYTI4NmZhOTEyZTY.-l0z">
   3. What is a Punnett square? How is it used?
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-MGNiZTlmNThiNzhkNjJjN2ZhOTVjNjVlNmRiMmZiZGM.-reg">
   4. What information must you know to determine the phenotypes of different genotypes for a gene with two alleles?
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-NTY2NDgxODVkMWRmYzk4NjZkMDk3NjBiYjM4NjU5MTU.-0z7">
   5. Based on the results of his experiments, what did Mendel conclude about the factors that control characteristics such as flower color?
  </p>
  <h3 id="x-ck12-QXBwbHkgQ29uY2VwdHM._1-wjn">
   Apply Concepts
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-YTFmYTBjOWRiYmQ3NWFlMjRhMDZmODFjODRhNTE1ZmE.-fkx">
   6. Draw a Punnett square of an
   <em>
    Ss
   </em>
   x
   <em>
    ss
   </em>
   cross. The S allele codes for long stems in pea plants and the s allele codes for short stems. If S is dominant to s, what percent of offspring would you expect to have each phenotype?
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-NTU5NDczZmFmODllOTQ1NmFmODA4NmRlZGNjYzdkODE.-6in">
   7. What letter should replace the question marks (?) in this Punnett square? Explain how you know.

   Think Critically
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NWMxZGU4NTIwZTZhNGYzNDQxYTk0ZDk4NzA5YTk3ZDg.-qgj">
   8. Explain how Mendel used math and probability to understand the results of his experiments.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-MmU3MzVkNzJhOTA1MTU5ZGQxYWI3ZWIxNjc3NDE1NTY.-djt">
   9. Compare and contrast codominance and incomplete dominance.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-MzAzMDM5NDU2NDdmYzFmNGMzODNkM2RkMjYzNTVlYzg.-zfx">
   10. Mendel investigated stem length, or height, in pea plants. What if he had investigated human height instead? Why would his results have been harder to interpret?

   Points to Consider
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZTcwYzcwMjNiODBkMGEzMDc4NjE5NzZmYjYwNDEyZTE.-hwn">
   Like most of the characteristics of living things, the characteristics Mendel studied in pea plants are controlled by genes. All the cells of an organism contain the same genes, because all organisms begin as a single cell. Most of the genes code for proteins.
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-YjFlMDU4ZTI2MzEyY2NkMzBiYjJmMjI0YTVlYmVjMGQ.-fvr">
   <li>
    How is the information encoded in a gene translated into a protein? Where does this occur, and what processes are involved?
   </li>
   <li>
    If cells have the same genes, how do you think different cells arise in an organism? For example, how did you come to have different skin, bone, and blood cells if all of your cells contain the same genes?
   </li>
  </ul>
