    If you take a walk in a damp wooded area in the spring, you might smell this interesting plant before you notice its striking yellow hood. The hood surrounds a stalk covered with tiny flowers. It&#8217;s an intriguing sight&#8212;but don&#8217;t get too close! It grows on a plant called the skunk cabbage. It&#8217;s aptly named for its unpleasant odor, which smells like rotten meat. The plant stores food in its fleshy roots all winter so it can grow the hood and flowers in the spring. They emerge from the soil so early that there may still be snow on the ground, but the plant produces enough heat to melt the snow.

    Why does the skunk cabbage put so much energy into producing its unusual, smelly flowers? As you will read in this chapter, flowering plants have devised many ways to attract pollinators to their flowers so they can reproduce. The skunk cabbage is no exception. What pollinators do you think its stinky flowers might attract?

   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZmNlZWY1ZDcyMjdiODNkODU4ZWFlMjZiZTgxNzlkYzY.-tyc">
   Like the skunk cabbage, most of the plants you are familiar with produce flowers. However, plants existed for hundreds of millions of years before they evolved flowers. In fact, the earliest plants were different from most modern plants in several important ways. They not only lacked flowers. They also lacked leaves, roots, and stems. You might not even recognize them as plants. So why are the earliest plants placed in the plant kingdom? What traits define a plant?

   What Are Plants?
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZWNkMzIyMmJmMDExMDU3ZTc0YzRlYmU1M2M3MDYyNTg.-ynf">
   Plants are multicellular eukaryotes with cell walls made of cellulose. Plant cells also have chloroplasts. In addition, plants have specialized reproductive organs. These are structures that produce reproductive cells. Male reproductive organs produce sperm, and female reproductive organs produce eggs. Male and female reproductive organs may be on the same or different plants.

   Almost all plants make food by photosynthesis. Only about 1 percent of the estimated 300,000 species of plants have lost the ability to photosynthesize. These other species are consumers, many of them predators. How do plants prey on other organisms? The Venus fly trap in

   What Do Plants Need?
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MGJhMjY2NGRmNGJkZmU4NGU5NzkwNzRjYTMxYTAzNjM.-gaw">
   Plants need temperatures above freezing while they are actively growing and photosynthesizing. They also need sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water for photosynthesis. Like most other organisms, plants need oxygen for cellular respiration and minerals to build proteins and other organic molecules. Most plants support themselves above the ground with stiff stems in order to get light, carbon dioxide, and oxygen. Most plants also grow roots down into the soil to absorb water and minerals.

   The Importance of Plants
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-MzkxY2IzNzVmNmEwNmY5N2JjYzg0ZDdiOTQwZDk1Y2E.-unz">
   The importance of plants to humans and just about all other life on Earth is staggering. Life as we know it would not be possible without plants. Why are plants so important?
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-ODA1ZDdkMWQyZjlmM2ZlMmU0YjQ0ZDRmNDU4YzFmMzk.-meo">
   <li>
    Plants supply food to nearly all terrestrial organisms, including humans. We eat either plants or other organisms that eat plants.
   </li>
   <li>
    Plants maintain the atmosphere. They produce oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. Oxygen is essential for cellular respiration for all aerobic organisms. It also maintains the ozone layer that helps protect Earth&#8217;s life from damaging UV radiation. Removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere reduces the greenhouse effect and global warming.
   </li>
   <li>
    Plants recycle matter in biogeochemical cycles. For example, through transpiration, plants move enormous amounts of water from the soil to the atmosphere. Plants such as peas host bacteria that fix nitrogen. This makes nitrogen available to all plants, which pass it on to consumers.
   </li>
   <li>
    Plants provide many products for human use, such as firewood, timber, fibers, medicines, dyes, pesticides, oils, and rubber.
   </li>
   <li>
    Plants create habitats for many organisms. A single tree may provide food and shelter to many species of insects, worms, small mammals, birds, and reptiles (see

   <strong>
    Weeds

   are plants that grow where people don&#8217;t want them, such as gardens and lawns. They take up space and use resources, hindering the growth of more desirable plants. People often introduce plants to new habitats where they lack natural predators and parasites. The introduced plants may spread rapidly and drive out native plants. Many plants produce pollen, which can cause allergies. Plants may also produce toxins that harm human health (see

   By the time the earliest plants evolved, animals were already the dominant living things in the ocean. Plants were also constrained to the upper layer of water that received enough sunlight for photosynthesis. Therefore, plants never became dominant marine organisms. But when plants moved to land, everything was wide open. Why was the land devoid of other life? Without plants growing on land, there was nothing for other organisms to feed on. Land could not be colonized by other organisms until land plants became established.

   Colonization of the land was a huge step in plant evolution. Until then, virtually all life had evolved in the ocean. Dry land was a very different kind of place. The biggest problem was the dryness. Simply absorbing enough water to stay alive was a huge challenge. It kept early plants small and low to the ground. Water was also needed for sexual reproduction, so sperm could swim to eggs. In addition, temperatures on land were extreme and always changing. Sunlight was also strong and dangerous. It put land organisms at high risk of mutations.

They also carry food (sugar dissolved in water) from photosynthetic cells to other cells in the plant for growth or storage. The evolution of vascular tissues revolutionized the plant kingdom. The tissues allowed plants to grow large and endure periods of drought in harsh land environments. Early vascular plants probably resembled the fern shown in

   In addition to vascular tissues, these early plants evolved other adaptations to life on land, including lignin, leaves, roots, and a change in their life cycle.
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-NmYyODU1YTYwZjA4MjlhNjFkNzRkY2VlMzc0YThmZDQ.-ksz">
   <li>
    <strong>
     Lignin
    </strong>
    is a tough carbohydrate molecule that is hydrophobic (&#8220;water fearing&#8221;). It adds support to vascular tissues in stems. It also waterproofs the tissues so they don&#8217;t leak, which makes them more efficient at transporting fluids. Because most other organisms cannot break down lignin, it helps protect plants from herbivores and parasites.
   </li>
   <li>
    Leaves are rich in chloroplasts that function as solar collectors and food factories. The first leaves were very small, but leaves became larger over time.
   </li>
   <li>
    Roots are vascular organs that can penetrate soil and even rock. They absorb water and minerals from soil and carry them to leaves. They also anchor a plant in the soil. Roots evolved from rhizoids, which nonvascular plants had used for absorption.
   </li>
   <li>
    Land plants evolved a dominant diploid sporophyte generation. This was adaptive because diploid individuals are less likely to suffer harmful effects of mutations. They have two copies of each gene, so if a mutation occurs in one gene, they have a backup copy. This is extremely important on land, where there&#8217;s a lot of solar radiation.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p id="x-ck12-YWFhMmE1MDRkODEzMWY2YTZmZWIzOGI0NTY1YmE1ZmE.-g0w">
   With all these advantages, it&#8217;s easy to see why vascular plants spread quickly and widely on land. Many nonvascular plants went extinct as vascular plants became more numerous. Vascular plants are now the dominant land plants on Earth.

   Seed Plants Emerge
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ODlkOGM0N2RmNzZkOTU4NWIzNDNkNDY4MDVmZTBmNjA.-rx2">
   For reproduction, early vascular plants still needed moisture. Sperm had to swim from male to female reproductive organs for fertilization. Spores also needed some water to grow and often to disperse as well. Of course, dryness and other harsh conditions made it very difficult for tiny new offspring plants to survive. With the evolution of seeds in vascular plants, all that changed. Seed plants evolved a number of adaptations that made it possible to reproduce without water. As a result, seed plants were wildly successful. They exploded into virtually all of Earth&#8217;s habitats.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-MTZlMjU2NmMwYjAwZjUyMGVhOGM0ODA5ZDhlMDUxZjQ.-q2d">
   Why are seeds so adaptive on land? A
   <strong>
    seed
   </strong>
   contains an embryo and a food supply enclosed within a tough coating. An embryo is a zygote that has already started to develop and grow. Early growth and development of a plant embryo in a seed is called
   <strong>
    germination
   </strong>
   . The seed protects and nourishes the embryo and gives it a huge head start in the &#8220;race&#8221; of life. Many seeds can wait to germinate until conditions are favorable for growth. This increases the offspring&#8217;s chance of surviving even more.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-YzkzOWIyYjUwNzUwNWJiOTM2Njg0MzhiYzc0MTZkOTI.-nmq">
   Other reproductive adaptations that evolved in seed plants include ovules, pollen, pollen tubes, and pollination by animals.
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-ODYxMzhkNDNkYWJjNzg5OTEzYjA2NTExM2JmZDg2NWM.-yu8">
   <li>
    An
    <strong>
     ovule
    </strong>
    is a female reproductive structure in seed plants that contains a tiny female gametophyte. The gametophyte produces an egg cell. After the egg is fertilized by sperm, the ovule develops into a seed.
   </li>
   <li>
    A grain of pollen is a tiny male gametophyte enclosed in a tough capsule (see
    <strong>
     Figure
    </strong>

    ). It carries sperm to an ovule while preventing it from drying out. Pollen grains can&#8217;t swim, but they are very light, so the wind can carry them. Therefore, they can travel through air instead of water.
   </li>
   <li>
    Wind-blown pollen might land anywhere and be wasted. Another adaptation solved this problem. Plants evolved traits that attract specific animal pollinators. Like the bee in
    <strong>
     Figure
    </strong>
    <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTE1LTEwLXBvbGxlbi1ncmFpbi1iZWUtY29tcG9zaXRl">

    </a>
    , a pollinator picks up pollen on its body and carries it directly to another plant of the same species. This greatly increases the chance that fertilization will occur.
   </li>
   <li>
    Pollen also evolved the ability to grow a tube, called a pollen tube, through which sperm could be transferred directly from the pollen grain to the egg. This allowed sperm to reach an egg without swimming through a film of water. It finally freed up plants from depending on moisture to reproduce.

   Lesson Summary
  </h2>
  <ul id="x-ck12-Mzk4N2MwNGQ4N2FjNzQ0YTc2NzRjNDdkMGMxYjlhNjU.-pvp">
   <li>
    Plants are multicellular eukaryotes. They have organelles called chloroplasts and cell walls made of cellulose. Plants also have specialized reproductive organs. Almost all plants make food by photosynthesis. Life as we know it would not be possible without plants.
   </li>
   <li>
    All plants have a characteristic life cycle that includes alternation of generations. Asexual reproduction with spores produces a haploid gametophyte generation. Sexual reproduction with gametes and fertilization produces a diploid sporophyte generation.
   </li>
   <li>
    The earliest plants are thought to have evolved in the ocean from a green alga ancestor. Plants were among the earliest organisms to leave the water and colonize land. The evolution of vascular tissues allowed plants to grow larger and thrive on land. The evolution of seeds and pollen allowed them to reproduce on land without moisture. Flowering plants evolved flowers with ovaries that formed fruits. They have been the most successful plants of all.
   </li>
   <li>
    The most basic division of living plants is between nonvascular and vascular plants. Vascular plants are further divided into seedless and seed plants. Seed plants called gymnosperms produce seeds in cones. Seed plants called angiosperms produce seeds in the ovaries of flowers.

   Bryophytes also depend on moisture to reproduce. Sperm produced by a male gametophyte must swim through a layer of rainwater or dew to reach an egg produced by a female gametophyte. The tiny, diploid sporophyte generation then undergoes meiosis to produce haploid spores. The spores may also need moisture to disperse.

   The first vascular plants evolved about 420 million years ago. They probably evolved from moss-like bryophyte ancestors, but they had a life cycle dominated by the diploid sporophyte generation. As they continued to evolve, early vascular plants became more plant-like in other ways as well.
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-OWM3OTlhMmNlNGM4ODU1ZmFjMThlYmFlYTdjMmJlNmI.-awv">
   <li>
    Vascular plants evolved true roots made of vascular tissues. Compared with rhizoids, roots can absorb more water and minerals from the soil. They also anchor plants securely in the ground, so plants can grow larger without toppling over.
   </li>
   <li>
    Vascular plants evolved stems made of vascular tissues and lignin. Because of lignin, stems are stiff, so plants can grow high above the ground where they can get more light and air. Because of their vascular tissues, stems keep even tall plants supplied with water so they don&#8217;t dry out in the air.
   </li>
   <li>
    Vascular plants evolved leaves to collect sunlight. At first, leaves were tiny and needle-like, which helped reduce water loss. Later, leaves were much larger and broader, so plants could collect more light.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZTc5ZjIxNTY0YzliMjQwYTgyODc5MjFmODY1MmFlNTg.-mdq">
   With their vascular tissues and other adaptations, early vascular plants had the edge over nonvascular plants. The could grow tall and take advantage of sunlight high up in the air. Bryophytes were the photosynthetic pioneers onto land, but early vascular plants were the photosynthetic pioneers into air.

   Eventually, some gymnosperms started to evolve angiosperm-like traits. For example, cycad ancestors were the first plants to use insects as pollinators. They also used birds and monkeys to disperse their brightly colored seeds. Of modern gymnosperms, Gnetae probably share the most recent common ancestor with angiosperms. Among other similarities, Gnetae produce
   <strong>
    nectar
   </strong>
   , a sweet, sugary liquid that attracts insect pollinators. Most modern flowering plants also produce nectar.

   <li>
    The
    <strong>
     stamen
    </strong>
    is the male reproductive structure of a flower. It consists of a stalk-like filament that ends in an anther. The anther contains pollen sacs, in which meiosis occurs and pollen grains form. The filament raises the anther up high so its pollen will be more likely to blow in the wind or be picked up by an animal pollinator.
   </li>
   <li>
    The
    <strong>
     pistil
    </strong>
    is the female reproductive structure of a flower. It consists of a stigma, style, and ovary. The stigma is raised and sticky to help it catch pollen. The style supports the stigma and connects it to the ovary, which contains the egg.
    <strong>
     Petals
    </strong>
    attract pollinators to the flower. Petals are often brightly colored so pollinators will notice them.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Sepals
    </strong>
    protect the developing flower while it is still a bud. Sepals are usually green, which camouflages the bud from possible consumers.

   Flowers and Pollinators
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NGVhZjMxNjc4YTNiMDY5YTMzYzE1NGI1MzViY2IyZDA.-ivp">
   Many flowers have bright colors, strong scents, and sweet nectar to attract animal pollinators. They may attract insects, birds, mammals, and even reptiles. While visiting a flower, a pollinator picks up pollen from the anthers. When the pollinator visits the next flower, some of the pollen brushes off on the stigma. This allows cross-pollination, which increases genetic diversity.

   Evolution of Flowering Plants
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-OTIyODQzZjg4Nzc4ZTI4YTE3YzU4MjcwZDFhOTAxNDU.-gk3">
   Flowering plants are thought to have evolved at least 200 million years ago from gymnosperms like Gnetae. The earliest known fossils of flowering plants are about 125 million years old. The fossil flowers have male and female reproductive organs but no petals or sepals.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-YzgwZTEyZTE1MDk5MDgzNGU5NmY4NjUwYzBlMmViNDA.-rbu">
   Scientists think that the earliest flowers attracted insects and other animals, which spread pollen from flower to flower. This greatly increased the efficiency of fertilization over wind-spread pollen, which might or might not actually land on another flower. To take better advantage of this &#8220;animal labor,&#8221; plants evolved traits such as brightly colored petals to attract pollinators. In exchange for pollination, flowers gave the pollinators nectar.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-NGY4M2NiMDlhMzNjMmFmMmM4NTE5NTM3NjZmMGNhNmE.-c7k">
   Giving free nectar to any animal that happened to come along was not an efficient use of resources. Much of the pollen might be carried to flowers of different species and therefore wasted. As a result, many plants evolved ways to &#8220;hide&#8221; their nectar from all but very specific pollinators, which would be more likely to visit only flowers of the same species. For their part, animal pollinators co-evolved traits that allowed them to get to the hidden nectar. Two examples of this type of co-evolution are shown in

   Some of the most recent angiosperms to evolve are grasses. Humans started domesticating grasses such as wheat about 10,000 years ago. Why grasses? They have many large, edible seeds that contain a lot of nutritious stored food. They are also relatively easy to harvest. Since then, humans have helped shaped the evolution of grasses, as illustrated by the example in

   There are more than a quarter million species of flowering plants, and they show tremendous diversity. Nonetheless, almost all flowering plants fall into one of three major groups: monocots, eudicots, or magnolids. The three groups differ in several ways. For example, monocot embryos form just one cotyledon, whereas eudicot and magnolid embryos form two cotyledons. The arrangement of their vascular tissues is also different. Examples of the three groups of flowering plants are given in

  <ul id="x-ck12-N2UyMmM0YzQxY2IxNTViODQ0NzMxZjE2NWIwYTdlNTc.-zje">
   <li>
    Nonvascular plants are called bryophytes. They include liverworts, hornworts, and mosses. They lack roots, stems, and leaves. They are low-growing, reproduce with spores, and need a moist habitat.
   </li>
   <li>
    Vascular plants are known as tracheophytes. Vascular tissues include xylem and phloem. They allow plants to grow tall in the air without drying out. Vascular plants also have roots, stems, and leaves.
   </li>
   <li>
    Most vascular plants are seed plants, or spermatophytes. They reproduce with seeds and pollen. Some modern seed plants are gymnosperms that produce seeds in cones.
   </li>
   <li>
    Most modern seed plants are angiosperms that produce seeds in the ovaries of flowers. Ovaries may develop into fruits. Flowers attract pollinators, and fruits are eaten by animals, which help disperse the seeds.
