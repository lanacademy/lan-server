    Is this picture a colorful work of abstract art, or is it something else? Imagine shrinking down to a tiny size, so small you could enter a blood vessel. The picture shows what you might see rushing toward you. Do you know what the red objects are? If you guessed red blood cells, you are right. What about the knobby green objects? Watch out for these! They are viruses that have invaded the blood. When you read this book, you will take an exciting journey into the realm of blood cells, viruses, and just about everything else that is related to life. You will learn how your own body works, what makes living things unique, and what you and viruses have in common. This first chapter explains how scientists learn about the natural world and introduces you to biology, the science of life.

   Introduction

   Did you ever wonder why giraffes have such long necks or how birds learn to sing their special songs? If you ever asked questions such as these about the natural world, then you were thinking like a scientist. The word
   <em>
    science
   </em>
   comes from a Latin word that means &#8220;knowledge.&#8221;
   <strong>
    Science
   </strong>
   is a distinctive way of gaining knowledge about the natural world that starts with a question and then tries to answer the question with evidence and logic. Science is an exciting exploration of all the whys and hows that any curious person might have about the world. You can be part of that exploration. Besides your curiosity, all you need is a basic understanding of how scientists think and how science is done, starting with the goal of science.

   The Goal of Science
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZTQ5OTFiYWVlNTQ0NGQ2OWQzYzNkZTY1ZGNkOGFkZTk.-ezp">
   The goal of science is to understand the natural world. To achieve this goal, scientists make certain assumptions. They assume that:
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-ZjYyYjllZDE0NzFlOGJkMjlmM2EyODhlMzI2ZThlOWE.-7ls">
   <li>
    Nature can be understood through systematic study.
   </li>
   <li>
    Scientific ideas are open to revision.

   Nature Can Be Understood
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NzkwNGQ2ZWE0ZTQzZmNmZGYyZWM3NWM0NTFhMDY4NzM.-c84">
   Scientists think of nature as a single system controlled by natural laws. By discovering natural laws, scientists strive to increase their understanding of the natural world. Laws of nature are expressed as scientific laws. A
   <strong>
    scientific law
   </strong>
   is a statement that describes what always happens under certain conditions in nature.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZDFjYjIwNThlOWFmMDY4Zjk4OWYzODNiOGQ2MzVlNDY.-yyi">
   An example of a scientific law is the law of gravity, which was discovered by Sir Isaac Newton (see
   <strong>
    Figure
   </strong>
   <a href="#x-ck12-QklPLTAxLTAxLU5ld3Rvbg..">
    below
   </a>
   ). The law of gravity states that objects always fall towards Earth because of the pull of gravity. Based on this law, Newton could explain many natural events. He could explain not only why objects such as apples always fall to the ground, but he could also explain why the moon orbits Earth. Isaac Newton discovered laws of motion as well as the law of gravity. His laws of motion allowed him to explain why objects move as they do.

   Scientific Ideas Can Change
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-OTZlNzU1NGQ4YjZlZTM4NDg2ZWQ1ZGU0MzdlNTUzZWY.-df7">
   Science is more of a process than a set body of knowledge. Scientists are always testing and revising their ideas, and as new observations are made, existing ideas may be challenged. Ideas may be replaced with new ideas that better fit the facts, but more often existing ideas are simply revised. For example, when Albert Einstein developed his theory of relativity, he didn&#8217;t throw out Newton&#8217;s laws of motion. Instead, he showed that Newton&#8217;s laws are a part of a bigger picture. In this way, scientists gradually build an increasingly accurate and detailed understanding of the natural world.

   Scientific Knowledge Can Withstand the Test of Time
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-YTEwNjhmYmMxYjMyNzg4NDc5ZGQzZmMwYzhhMWMxMDU.-4n3">
   Many scientific ideas have withstood the test of time. For example, about 200 years ago, the scientist John Dalton proposed atomic theory&#8212;the theory that all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. This theory is still valid today. There are many other examples of basic science ideas that have been tested repeatedly and found to be true. You will learn about many of them as you study biology.

   Science Cannot Answer All Questions
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NDA5ZWUyY2U4MGU0MjYxMzM2NGEyZDExNDI0Yzg0M2Y.-a1o">
   Science rests on evidence and logic, so it deals only with things that can be observed. An
   <strong>
    observation
   </strong>
   is anything that is detected either through human senses or with instruments and measuring devices that extend human senses. Things that cannot be observed or measured by current means&#8212;such as supernatural beings or events&#8212;are outside the bounds of science. Consider these two questions about life on Earth:
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-MDQ5Y2QzMGI2NWZkM2M2ZjM1MDI1OTQxZTRhYzY3NWE.-vba">

   </li>
  </ul>
  <p id="x-ck12-MmM4NWNiOTQ1ODFiNTEzYjlhM2I0NmJhOTgzOTZkZTg.-alc">
   The first question can be answered by science on the basis of scientific evidence and logic. The second question could be a matter of belief. Therefore, it is outside the realm of science.

   Asking a Question
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NDEzMjA3NmQ3YmMwMzIyMGZjNjlmYTcxZWYxN2NlNWE.-ep7">
   Observations often lead to questions. For example, you might ask yourself why the moth has eye spots that make it look like an owl&#8217;s face. What reason might there be for this observation?
  </p>
  <h3 id="x-ck12-Rm9ybWluZyBhIEh5cG90aGVzaXM.-euc">
   Forming a Hypothesis
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MmUxOTk2MjhlODljMDYzOWU3ZWYxOTc4ZDFhN2IxZmQ.-yq0">
   The next step in a scientific investigation is forming a hypothesis. A
   <strong>
    hypothesis
   </strong>
   is a possible answer to a scientific question, but it isn&#8217;t just any answer. A hypothesis must be based on scientific knowledge, and it must be logical. A hypothesis also must be falsifiable. In other words, it must be possible to make observations that would disprove the hypothesis if it really is false. Assume you know that some birds eat moths and that owls prey on other birds. From this knowledge, you reason that eye spots scare away birds that might eat the moth. This is your hypothesis.
  </p>
  <h3 id="x-ck12-VGVzdGluZyB0aGUgSHlwb3RoZXNpcw..-lwj">
   Testing the Hypothesis
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NjYxMTYzMzBlNzQ3OTQyNTkxOTg1OGZjYjMwYjlmNmQ.-ixk">
   To test a hypothesis, you first need to make a prediction based on the hypothesis. A
   <strong>
    prediction
   </strong>
   is a statement that tells what will happen under certain conditions. It can be expressed in the form: If A occurs, then B will happen. Based on your hypothesis, you might make this prediction: If a moth has eye spots on its wings, then birds will avoid eating it.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-MmM4YjYxMzliZTM0N2EwM2U2MjBmNjA1ZDcxMWQzMmQ.-9p5">
   Next, you must gather evidence to test your prediction.
   <strong>
    Evidence
   </strong>
   is any type of data that may either agree or disagree with a prediction, so it may either support or disprove a hypothesis. Assume that you gather evidence by making more observations of moths with eye spots. Perhaps you observe that birds really do avoid eating the moths. This evidence agrees with your prediction.
  </p>
  <h3 id="x-ck12-RHJhd2luZyBDb25jbHVzaW9ucw..-now">
   Drawing Conclusions
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NmVlMzA4MTQ4MjUwZjI5NDg2Mjg4YTQ5ODk1MjliNDY.-n4p">
   Evidence that agrees with your prediction supports your hypothesis. Does such evidence prove that your hypothesis is true? No; a hypothesis cannot be proven conclusively to be true. This is because you can never examine all of the possible evidence, and someday evidence might be found that disproves the hypothesis. Nonetheless, the more evidence that supports a hypothesis, the more likely the hypothesis is to be true.
  </p>
  <h3 id="x-ck12-Q29tbXVuaWNhdGluZyBSZXN1bHRz-xgh">
   Communicating Results
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MDBiYmY1YWJlMDgwNGViZDhlMDFlOWYwMjBkZGFiMjQ.-cn6">
   The last step in a scientific investigation is communicating what you have learned with others. This is a very important step because it allows others to test your hypothesis. If other researchers get the same results as yours, they add support to the hypothesis. However, if they get different results, they may disprove the hypothesis. When scientists share their results, they should describe their methods and point out any possible problems with the investigation. For example, while you were observing moths, perhaps your presence scared birds away. This introduces an error into your investigation. You got the results you predicted (the birds avoided the moths while you were observing them), but not for the reason you hypothesized. Other researchers might be able to think of ways to avoid this error in future studies.

   Sample Size and Repetition
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MzU5MDMyNGY5ODA5OTBkNDkxNzAzYzFlN2RjYTIyOWI.-rxt">
   The sample in an experiment or other investigation consists of the individuals or events that are studied. Typically, the sample is much smaller than all such individuals or events that exist in the world. Whether the results based on the sample are true in general cannot be known for certain. However, the larger the sample is, the more likely it is that the results are generally true. Similarly, the more times that an experiment is repeated and the same results obtained, the more likely the results are valid. This is why scientific experiments should always be repeated.

   Other Types of Scientific Investigations
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-YzVjMjBmNzk2NTVkMzAwNTRiMDY0NGZkYjkxMzhlODg.-vm3">
   Experiments are sometimes hard or even impossible to do. For example, a scientist who is studying an extinct animal cannot experiment with the animal because it no longer exists. The scientist must rely instead on evidence in the natural world, such as fossils that the extinct animal left behind.

   Natural Studies
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MWM4NzQwNmRmZGM3M2ExZmFmZjkxNjdjMDEzN2FmODc.-slo">
   When scientists do studies in nature, they usually cannot control factors that might affect the variables they are investigating. This is a drawback, because it may make the observations difficult to interpret. Without controls, it may not be possible to determine which of many factors explain the observations. For example, assume you are studying how plants grow in a forest or field. You cannot control the amount of sunlight or rain water the plants receive, so it will be difficult to determine which factors most influence plant growth. On the other hand, a natural study shows what actually occurs in nature. Therefore, it may provide a truer picture of what happens in the real world than an experiment does.

   Modeling
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-OWE4ZmRlOWQ5NmFjZWQ3Zjk0OTM0MmJlZGYzYjM5ZmU.-bvb">
   Another way to gain scientific knowledge without experiments is by making and manipulating models. A
   <strong>
    model
   </strong>
   is a representation of part of the real world. Did you ever build a model car? Scientific models are something like model cars; they represent the real world but are simpler than the real world. This is one reason that models are especially useful for investigating complex systems. By using a model, scientists can better understand how the real system works. An example of a scientific model is shown in

   Like a hypothesis, a model must be evaluated. It is assessed by criteria such as how well it represents the real world, what limitations it has, and how useful it is. The usefulness of a model depends on how well its predictions match observations of the real world. Even when a model&#8217;s predictions match real-world observations, however, it doesn&#8217;t prove that the model is true or that it is the only model that works.

   With repeated testing, some hypotheses may eventually become scientific theories. A
   <strong>
    scientific theory
   </strong>
   is a broad explanation for events that is widely accepted as true. To become a theory, a hypothesis must be tested over and over again, and it must be supported by a great deal of evidence. People commonly use the word
   <em>
    theory
   </em>
   to describe a guess about how or why something happens. For example, you might say, &#8220;I think a woodchuck dug this hole in the ground, but it&#8217;s just a theory.&#8221; Using the word
   <em>
    theory
   </em>
   in this way is different from the way it is used in science. A scientific theory is more like a fact than a guess because it is so well-supported. There are several well-known theories in biology, including the theory of evolution, cell theory, and germ theory.

   According to the
   <strong>
    cell theory
   </strong>
   , all living things are made up of cells, and living cells always come from other living cells. In fact, each living thing begins life as a single cell. Some living things, such as bacteria, remain single-celled. Other living things, including plants and animals, grow and develop into many cells. Your own body is made up of an amazing 100 trillion cells! But even you&#8212;like all other living things&#8212;began life as a single cell. More of the cell theory will be discussed in a later chapter.

   The
   <strong>
    gene theory
   </strong>
   is the idea that the characteristics of living things are controlled by genes, which are passed from parents to their offspring. Genes are located on larger structures, called chromosomes, that are found inside every cell. Chromosomes, in turn, contain large molecules known as DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). Molecules of DNA are encoded with instructions that tell cells what to do. To see how this happens, click on the animation titled

   Homeostasis
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MjU0NGRkOGYzOWYyNmIxNzdjMzEyNGU1MGI3NmQwOWE.-mfm">
   Homeostasis, or keeping things constant, is not just a characteristic of living things. It also applies to nature as a whole. Consider the concentration of oxygen in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. Oxygen makes up 21% of the atmosphere, and this concentration is fairly constant. What keeps the concentration of oxygen constant? The answer is living things. Most living things need oxygen to survive, and when they breathe, they remove oxygen from the atmosphere. On the other hand, many living things, including plants, give off oxygen when they make food, and this adds oxygen to the atmosphere. The concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere is maintained mainly by the balance between these two processes. A quick overview of homeostasis can be viewed at

   <strong>
    Evolution
   </strong>
   is a change in the characteristics of living things over time. Evolution occurs by a process called natural selection. In
   <strong>
    natural selection
   </strong>
   , some living things produce more offspring than others, so they pass more genes to the next generation than others do. Over many generations, this can lead to major changes in the characteristics of living things. Evolution explains how living things are changing today and how modern living things have descended from ancient life forms that no longer exist on Earth. As living things evolve, they generally become better suited for their environment. This is because they evolve adaptations. An
   <strong>
    adaptation
   </strong>
   is a characteristic that helps a living thing survive and reproduce in a given environment. Look at the mole in

   . It has tentacles around its nose that it uses to sense things by touch. The mole lives underground in the soil where it is always dark. However, by using its touch organ, it can detect even tiny food items in the soil in total darkness. The touch organ is an adaptation because it helps the mole survive in its dark, underground environment.

   Interdependence of Living Things

   All living things depend on their environment to supply them with what they need, including food, water, and shelter. Their environment consists of physical factors&#8212;such as soil, air, and temperature&#8212;and also of other organisms. An

    organism
   </strong>
   is an individual living thing. Many living things interact with other organisms in their environment. In fact, they may need other organisms in order to survive. For example, living things that cannot make their own food must eat other organisms for food. Other interactions between living things include symbiosis and competition.

   Darwin and the Theory of Evolution
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NjY2NGViYTJiZjBkMjYxM2MxNGRhOTMyZjk0ODE4Nzg.-i7o">
   The idea of evolution has been around for centuries. In fact, it goes all the way back to the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle. However, evolution is most often associated with Charles Darwin. Darwin published a book on evolution in 1869 titled
   <em>
    On the Origin of Species
   </em>
   . In the book, Darwin stated the theory of evolution by natural selection. He also presented a great deal of evidence that evolution occurs. Despite all the evidence Darwin presented, his theory was not well-received at first. Many people found it hard to accept the idea that humans had evolved from an ape-like ancestor, and they saw evolution as a challenge to their religious beliefs. Look at the cartoon in
   <strong>
    Figure
   </strong>
   <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTAxLTE1LURhcndpbi1jYXJ0b29u">
    below
   </a>
   . Drawn in 1871, it depicts Darwin himself as an ape. The cartoon reflects how many people felt about Darwin and his theory during his own time. Darwin had actually expected this type of reaction to his theory and had waited a long time before publishing his book for this reason. It was only when another scientist, named Alfred Wallace, developed essentially the same theory of evolution that Darwin put his book into print.

   Although Darwin presented a great deal of evidence for evolution in his book, he was unable to explain how evolution occurs. That&#8217;s because he knew nothing about genes. As a result, he didn&#8217;t know how characteristics are passed from parents to offspring, let alone how they could change over time.

   Evolutionary Theory After Darwin
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-M2RhZDQ2MDVlMzJlNDc2NjJlMjNiMTc2NTE5ZjBiNmY.-v4k">
   Since Darwin&#8217;s time, scientists have gathered even more evidence to support the theory of evolution. Some of the evidence comes from fossils, and some comes from studies that show how similar living things are to one another. By the 1930s, scientists had also learned about genes. As a result, they could finally explain how characteristics of organisms could pass from one generation to the next and change over time.

   Using modern technology, scientists can now directly compare the genes of living species. The more genes different species share in common, the more closely related the species are presumed to be. Consider humans and chimpanzees. They share about 98% of their genes. This means that they shared a common ancestor in the not-too-distant past. This is just one of many pieces of evidence that show we are part of the evolution of life on Earth.

   Misconceptions About Evolution
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ODI2ZDlkOGFmOTgwYmZiYWNiNzAyMDEwNGU1YjFkNjA.-uji">
   Today, evolution is still questioned by some people. Often, people who disagree with the theory of evolution do not really understand it. For example, some people think that the theory of evolution explains how life on Earth first began. In fact, the theory explains only how life changed after it first appeared. Some people think the theory of evolution means that humans evolved from modern apes. In fact, humans and modern apes have a common ancestor that lived several million years ago. These and other misconceptions about evolution contribute to the controversy that still surrounds this fundamental principle of biology.

   Lesson Summary
  </h2>
  <ul id="x-ck12-ZWMwYjZkMTNkNWYxZjI0MmZlOWRmNjU4M2JiYjJkMGY.-3i4">
   <li>
    Living things are distinguished from nonliving things on the basis of six characteristics: response to the environment, growth and development, reproduction, homeostasis, complex chemistry, and cells.
   </li>
   <li>
    Four underlying principles form the basis of biology. They are cell theory, gene theory, homeostasis, and evolution.
   </li>
   <li>
    Many living things interact with one another in some way. The interactions are often necessary for their survival.
   </li>
   <li>
    The great diversity of life on Earth today is the result of 4 billion years of evolution. During that time, living things evolved from simple, single-celled organisms to complex, multicellular life forms.
