    If you saw the movie
    <em>
     Finding Nemo,
    </em>
    then you probably recognize this fish. It&#8217;s known as a clownfish, and it&#8217;s swimming near the tentacles of an animal called a sea anemone. The sea anemone kills prey by injecting poison with its tentacles. For some reason, the anemone doesn&#8217;t harm the clownfish, perhaps because the fish has a coating of mucus that helps disguise it. But why does the clownfish &#8220;hang out&#8221; with the sea anemone? One reason is for the food. The clownfish eats the remains of the anemone&#8217;s prey after it finishes feeding. Another reason is safety. The clownfish is safe from predators when it&#8217;s near the anemone. Predators are scared away by the anemone&#8217;s poison tentacles. In return, the clownfish helps the anemone catch food by attracting prey with its bright colors. Its feces also provide nutrients to the anemone. The clownfish and anemone are just one example of the diverse ways that living things may help each other in nature. You will learn more about species interactions such as this when you read this chapter.

   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-MTZhOWRkOTc1ZmM1ZTZjYTVlZWZjY2NkMmQzOGVkZDM.-gln">
   Biomes as different as deserts and wetlands share something very important. All biomes have populations of interacting species. Species also interact in the same basic ways in all biomes. For example, all biomes have some species that prey on others for food. The focus of study of species interactions is the community.

   What Is a Community?
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZjJjMWNlZDdlMzRlZGI4YzgyYWE0ZjgwOTE0MDY3YTI.-2bh">
   A community is the biotic part of an ecosystem. It consists of all the populations of all the species in the same area. It also includes their interactions. Species interactions in communities are important factors in natural selection. They help shape the evolution of the interacting species. There are three major types of community interactions: predation, competition, and symbiosis.

   <strong>
    Predation
   </strong>
   is a relationship in which members of one species (the
   <strong>
    predator
   </strong>
   ) consume members of another species (the
   <strong>
    prey
   </strong>
   ). The lionesses and zebra in

   are classic examples of predators and prey. In addition to the lionesses, there is another predator in this figure. Can you spot it? The other predator is the zebra. Like the lionesses, it consumes prey species, in this case species of grass. However, unlike the lionesses, the zebra does not kill its prey. Predator-prey relationships such as these account for most energy transfers in food chains and food webs.

   . As the prey population increases, there is more food for predators. So, after a slight lag, the predator population increases as well. As the number of predators increases, more prey are captured. As a result, the prey population starts to decrease. What happens to the predator population then?

   Some predator species are known as keystone species. A
   <strong>
    keystone species
   </strong>
   is one that plays an especially important role in its community. Major changes in the numbers of a keystone species affect the populations of many other species in the community. For example, some sea star species are keystone species in coral reef communities. The sea stars prey on mussels and sea urchins, which have no other natural predators. If sea stars were removed from a coral reef community, mussel and sea urchin populations would have explosive growth. This, in turn, would drive out most other species. In the end, the coral reef community would be destroyed.

When a predator comes near, the fish touches the shrimp with its tail as a warning. Then, both fish and shrimp retreat to the burrow until the predator is gone. From their relationship, the shrimp gets a warning of approaching danger. The fish gets a safe retreat and a place to lay its eggs.

Some parasites live on the surface of their host. Others live inside their host. They may enter the host through a break in the skin or in food or water. For example, roundworms are parasites of mammals, including humans, cats, and dogs (see

   ). They change the environment and pave the way for other species to come into the area. Pioneer species are likely to include bacteria and lichens that can live on bare rock. Along with wind and water, they help weather the rock and form soil. Once soil begins to form, plants can move in. At first, the plants include grasses and other species that can grow in thin, poor soil. As more plants grow and die, organic matter is added to the soil. This improves the soil and helps it hold water. The improved soil allows shrubs and trees to move into the area.

This type of succession is faster because the soil is already in place. In this case, the pioneer species are plants such as grasses, birch trees, and fireweed. Organic matter from the pioneer species improves the soil. This lets other plants move into the area. An example of this type of succession is shown in

   Many early ecologists thought that a community always goes through the same series of stages during succession. They also assumed that succession always ends with a final stable stage. They called this stage the
   <strong>
    climax community

   Lesson Summary
  </h2>
  <ul id="x-ck12-MTA1MGQwYjM3ZmUwZDJiOTA4ZjZjOTkzZGRkYzQxNmY.-yqj">
   <li>
    A community is the biotic part of an ecosystem. It consists of all the populations of all the species that live in the same area. It also includes their interactions.
   </li>
   <li>
    Predation is a relationship in which members of one species (the predator) consume members of another species (the prey). A predator-prey relationship keeps the populations of both species in balance.
   </li>
   <li>
    Competition is a relationship between organisms that strive for the same resources in the same place. Intraspecific competition occurs between members of the same species. It improves the species&#8217; adaptations. Interspecific competition occurs between members of different species. It may lead to one species going extinct or both becoming more specialized.
   </li>
   <li>
    Symbiosis is a close relationship between two species in which at least one species benefits. Mutualism is a symbiotic relationship in which both species benefit. Commensalism is a symbiotic relationship in which one species benefits while the other species is not affected. Parasitism is a symbiotic relationship in which one species (the parasite) benefits while the other species (the host) is harmed.
   </li>
   <li>
    Ecological succession is the process in which a community changes through time. Primary succession occurs in an area that has never before been colonized. Secondary succession occurs in a formerly inhabited area that was disturbed.

   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-NjNiNjIzYzM0NTJjZjc4ZGIzMzZmZGM0NmQyNGI5MTE.-gtx">
   Communities are made up of populations of different species. In biology, a population is a group of organisms of the same species that live in the same area. The population is the unit of natural selection and evolution. How large a population is and how fast it is growing are often used as measures of its health.

   Population Size, Density, and Distribution
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-ODEwNzRlNDJjMDc1ZTQ3NTBkNTZmNThiZWMxNWFmMGE.-xeq">
   Population size is the number of individuals in a population. For example, a population of insects might consist of 100 individual insects, or many more. Population size influences the chances of a species surviving or going extinct. Generally, very small populations are at greatest risk of extinction. However, the size of a population may be less important than its density.

   <strong>
    Population density
   </strong>
   is the average number of individuals in a population per unit of area or volume. For example, a population of 100 insects that live in an area of 100 square meters has a density of 1 insect per square meter. If the same population lives in an area of only 1 square meter, what is its density? Which population is more crowded? How might crowding affect the health of a population?

  <p id="x-ck12-YzAxNTRmZjM3N2MzNjhhYTk2ODdjM2RlMWNmYTNkMGI.-jej">
   Population density just gives the average number of individuals per unit of area or volume. Often, individuals in a population are not spread out evenly. Instead, they may live in clumps or some other pattern (see

   Migration is another type of movement that changes population size.
   <strong>
    Migration
   </strong>
   is the regular movement of individuals or populations each year during certain seasons. The purpose of migration usually is to find food, mates, or other resources. For example, many Northern Hemisphere birds migrate thousands of miles south each fall. They go to areas where the weather is warmer and more resources are available (see

   Most populations do not live under ideal conditions. Therefore, most do not grow exponentially. Certainly, no population can keep growing exponentially for very long. Many factors may limit growth. Often, the factors are density dependent. These are factors that kick in when the population becomes too large and crowded. For example, the population may start to run out of food or be poisoned by its own wastes. As a result, population growth slows and population size levels off. Curve B in

   <li>
    Population size is the number of individuals in a population. Population density is the average number of individuals per unit of area or volume. The pattern of spacing of individuals in a population may be affected by characteristics of a species or its environment.
   </li>
   <li>
    The age-sex structure of a population is the number of individuals of each sex and age in the population. Age-sex structure influences population growth. It is represented by a population pyramid. The number of survivors at each age is plotted on a survivorship curve.
   </li>
   <li>
    Population growth rate is how fast a population changes in size over time. It is determined by rates of birth, death, immigration, and emigration.
   </li>
   <li>
    Under ideal conditions, populations can grow exponentially. The growth rate increases as the population gets larger. Most populations do not live under ideal conditions and grow logistically instead. Density-dependent factors slow population growth as population size nears the carrying capacity.

   arose about 200,000 years ago in Africa. Early humans lived in small populations of nomadic hunters and gatherers. They first left Africa about 40,000 years ago. They soon moved throughout Europe, Asia, and Australia. By 10,000 years ago, they had reached the Americas. During this long period, birth and death rates were both fairly high. As a result, population growth was slow. Humans invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also let them settle down in villages and cities for the first time. The death rate increased because of diseases associated with domestic animals and crowded living conditions. The birth rate increased because there was more food and settled life offered other advantages. The combined effect was continued slow population growth.

   At one time, scientists predicted that all human populations would pass through the same demographic transition as Europe and North America. Now, they are not so sure. Death rates have fallen throughout the world. No country today remains in Stage 1 of the transition. However, birth rates are still high in many poor countries. These populations seem to be stuck in Stage 2. An example is the African country of Angola. Its population pyramid for 2005 is shown in

   . This is a new stage of the demographic transition, referred to as Stage 5. You might think that a negative growth rate would be a good thing. In fact, it may cause problems. For example, growth-dependent industries decline. Supporting the large aging population is also a burden for the shrinking younger population of workers.

   Lesson Summary
  </h2>
  <ul id="x-ck12-YjhlOWI4OTQ5MzE4ZjFjMzg5ZDMzNjFjMTM4OGE3MDg.-hxw">
   <li>
    Early humans lived in small populations of nomadic hunters and gatherers. Both birth and death rates were fairly high. As a result, human population growth was very slow. The invention of agriculture increased both birth and death rates. The population continued to grow slowly.
   </li>
   <li>
    Major changes in the human population first began during the 1700s. This occurred in Europe and North America. First, death rates fell while birth rates remained high. This led to rapid population growth. Later, birth rates also fell. As a result, population growth slowed.
   </li>
   <li>
    Other countries have completed a similar demographic transition. However, some countries seem stalled at early stages. They have high birth rates and rapidly growing populations.
   </li>
   <li>
    The total human population may have to stop growing eventually. Even if we reduce our use of resources and distribute them more fairly, at some point the carrying capacity will be reached.

   A study released in August 2011 estimates that Earth has almost 8.8 million animal, plant and fungi species, but we've only discovered less than a quarter of them. So far, only 1.9 million species have been found. Recent newly discovered species have been very diverse: a psychedelic frogfish, a lizard the size of a dime and even a blind hairy mini-lobster at the bottom of the ocean. There are potential benefits from these undiscovered species, which need to be found before they disappear from the planet. The study estimates that of the 8.8 million species, about 6.5 million would be on land and 2.2 million in the ocean. The research estimates that animals rule with 7.8 million species, followed by fungi with 611,000 and plants with just shy of 300,000 species. See

  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-YWM0MDQyZTAxMzRkZDdlMjdhNzU2Y2Y2MzgwOTlmZDM.-n5s">
   <li>
    Wild plants and animals maintain a valuable pool of genetic variation. This is important because domestic species are genetically uniform. This puts them at great risk of dying out due to disease.
   </li>
   <li>
    Other organisms provide humans with many different products. Timber, fibers, adhesives, dyes, and rubber are just a few.
   </li>
   <li>
    Certain species may warn us of toxins in the environment. When the peregrine falcon nearly went extinct, for example, it warned us of the dangers of DDT.

   <li>
    More than half of the most important prescription drugs come from wild species. Only a fraction of species have yet been studied for their medical potential.

   Ecosystem Services of Biodiversity
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-YjA4NDFjZjAyZWRjNjEwOGNhNjVhNGU3ZDFlMTM4ZmQ.-uxq">
   Biodiversity generally increases the productivity and stability of ecosystems. It helps ensure that at least some species will survive environmental change. It also provides many other ecosystem services. For example:
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-NjMxODYxMjgzYmM3NGFhNzA4NmY5ZmU0MTBiMzQ3MjM.-aa3">
   <li>
    Plants and algae maintain the atmosphere. During photosynthesis, they add oxygen and remove carbon dioxide.
   </li>
   <li>
    Plants help prevent soil erosion. They also improve soil quality when they decompose.
   </li>
   <li>
    Microorganisms purify water in rivers and lakes. They also return nutrients to the soil.
   </li>
   <li>
    Bacteria fix nitrogen and make it available to plants. Other bacteria recycle the nitrogen from organic wastes and remains of dead organisms.
   </li>
   <li>
    Insects and birds pollinate flowering plants, including crop plants.
   </li>
   <li>
    Natural predators control insect pests. They reduce the need for expensive pesticides, which may harm people and other living things.
   </li>

   Human Actions and the Sixth Mass Extinction
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-YTE5ZjI1Yjc0ZTkwOTBmZDNkZjI0ZjVhZGY5NTVhODc.-idv">
   Over 99 percent of all species that ever lived on Earth have gone extinct. Five mass extinctions are recorded in the fossil record. They were caused by major geologic and climatic events. Evidence shows that a
   <strong>
    sixth mass extinction
   </strong>
   is occurring now. Unlike previous mass extinctions, the sixth extinction is due to human actions.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-YTljOWM5OTMxZTA0MWIyYzU1ODNkZjQ2Yzg1NmU0ZGI.-t9r">
   Some scientists consider the sixth extinction to have begun with early hominids during the Pleistocene. They are blamed for over-killing big mammals such as mammoths. Since then, human actions have had an ever greater impact on other species. The present rate of extinction is between 100 and 100,000 species per year. In 100 years, we could lose more than half of Earth&#8217;s remaining species.

   Causes of Extinction
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NTQ3NjkxNTZmOWViOTcwNmNhY2Y2YjdlYmIyZmIzZDE.-y30">
   The single biggest cause of extinction today is
   <strong>
    habitat loss
   </strong>
   . Agriculture, forestry, mining, and urbanization have disturbed or destroyed more than half of Earth&#8217;s land area. In the U.S., for example, more than 99 percent of tall-grass prairies have been lost. Other causes of extinction today include:
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-YWY0ZTBkYmU1MDMzZjgwZDUyZGRkODk1NDg5Njg0MDQ.-lc8">
   <li>
    <strong>
     Exotic species
    </strong>
    introduced by humans into new habitats. They may carry disease, prey on native species, and disrupt food webs. Often, they can out-compete native species because they lack local predators. An example is described in
    <strong>

   <li>
    Over-harvesting of fish, trees, and other organisms. This threatens their survival and the survival of species that depend on them.
   </li>
   <li>
    Global climate change, largely due to the burning of fossil fuels. This is raising Earth&#8217;s air and ocean temperatures. It is also raising sea levels. These changes threaten many species.
   </li>
   <li>
    Pollution, which adds chemicals, heat, and noise to the environment beyond its capacity to absorb them. This causes widespread harm to organisms.
   </li>
   <li>
    Human overpopulation, which is crowding out other species. It also makes all the other causes of extinction worse.

   Effects of Extinction
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-OWJjNTAyZDliNzVhNzNiNzBkODc0ZjJiZDlkNmQwZTc.-c5d">
   The results of a study released in the summer of 2011 have shown that the decline in the numbers of large predators like sharks, lions and wolves is disrupting Earth's ecosystem in all kinds of unusual ways. The study, conducted by scientists from 22 different institutions in six countries, confirmed the sixth mass extinction. The study states that this mass extinction differs from previous ones because it is entirely driven by human activity through changes in land use, climate, pollution, hunting, fishing and poaching. The effects of the loss of these large predators can be seen in the oceans and on land.
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-NmY2NGIzOTc5MWFhZWU1NjA1NjU1Njc3ZWNhYTE1ZWI.-kfs">
   <li>
    Fewer cougars in the western US state of Utah led to an explosion of the deer population. The deer ate more vegetation, which altered the path of local streams and lowered overall biodiversity.
   </li>
   <li>
    In Africa, where lions and leopard are being lost to poachers, there is a surge in the numbers of olive baboons who are transferring intestinal parasites to human who live nearby.
   </li>
   <li>
    In the oceans, industrial whaling led a change in the diets of killer whales, who eat more sea lion, seals and otters and dramatically lowered those population counts.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p id="x-ck12-NGYyYmJhZDU2OTkyYzExY2QzNDY5YzEzOTM5MTNkYWY.-abm">
   The study concludes that the loss of big predators has likely driven many of the pandemics, population collapses and ecosystem shifts the Earth has seen in recent centuries. See

  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-YWY4ZWNjMjVhZjY5N2ZjODhiNTc0Y2QwNGFmN2NiNzY.-fjy">
   <li>
    Consume wisely. Reduce your consumption wherever possible. Re-use or recycle rather than throw out and buy new. When you do buy new, choose products that are energy efficient and durable.
   </li>
   <li>
    Avoid plastics. Plastics are made from petroleum and produce toxic waste.
   </li>
   <li>
    Go organic. Organically grown food is better for your health. It also protects the environment from pesticides and excessive nutrients in fertilizers.
   </li>
   <li>
    Save energy. Unplug electronic equipment and turn off lights when not in use. Take mass transit instead of driving.

   <em>
    life
   </em>
   that exists in developing countries is often not available within their borders. Biologists have long considered that access to the published literature is one of the chief impediments to the efficiency of research in the field. Among other results, free global access to digitized versions of the literature would make available information about the Earth&#8217;s species to all parts of the world. Many of the texts digitized by the BHL have until now only been held in a few European or North American libraries. Now, with this resource, scientists and student in the developing world have access to them, thereby accelerating biodiversity research.

   Since 2009, the BHL has expanded globally. The European Commission&#8217;s eContentPlus program has recently funded the BHL-Europe project, with 28 institutions, to assemble the European language literature. Additionally, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Atlas of Living Australia, Brazil, and the Bibliotheca Alexandrina have created regional BHL sites. These projects will work together to share content, protocols, services, and digital preservation practices.

   <strong>
    Nonrenewable resources
   </strong>
   are natural resources that exist in fixed amounts and can be used up. Examples include fossil fuels such as petroleum, coal, and natural gas. These fuels formed from the remains of plants over hundreds of millions of years. We are using them up far faster than they could ever be replaced. At current rates of use, petroleum will be used up in just a few decades and coal in less than 300 years. Nuclear power is also considered to be a nonrenewable resource because it uses up uranium, which will sooner or later run out. It also produces harmful wastes that are difficult to dispose of safely.

   <strong>
    Soil
   </strong>
   is a mixture of eroded rock, minerals, partly decomposed organic matter, and other materials. It is essential for plant growth, so it is the foundation of terrestrial ecosystems. Soil is important for other reasons as well. For example, it removes toxins from water and breaks down wastes.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-NDA0NTJhMWEyZjgwY2NjZDZkMzEyNWM3NTdjMjRjMmM.-frm">
   Although renewable, soil takes a very long to form&#8212;up to hundreds of millions of years. So, for human purposes, soil is a nonrenewable resource. It is also constantly depleted of nutrients through careless use and eroded by wind and water. For example, misuse of soil caused a huge amount of it to simply blow away in the 1930s during the Dust Bowl (see

   Too Much of a Good Thing
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-YTE0NjQxMWJjN2FhMTVkMDRhMjZkNzMxOTQxOTgyZDc.-0jz">
   Water pollution comes from many sources. One of the biggest sources is runoff. Runoff picks up chemicals such as fertilizer from agricultural fields, lawns, and golf courses. It carries the chemicals to bodies of water. The added nutrients from fertilizer often cause excessive growth of algae, creating
   <strong>
    algal blooms
   </strong>
   (see

   <strong>
    dead zones
   </strong>
   , where low oxygen levels have killed all ocean life. A very large dead zone exists in the Gulf of Mexico. Measures that can help prevent these problems include cutting down on fertilizer use. Preserving wetlands also helps because wetlands filter runoff.

   Ozone Depletion
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MTE5OTYzMDQxNjVmNGQyMDNmOTA0NTMyNWM4NTg3YWU.-cxa">
   There are two types of ozone. You can think of them as bad ozone and good ozone. Both are affected by air pollution.
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-ODAzMDU2OTE1ZDhiNmE4NTQxZDI1NTFjMzMxZjE0ZmQ.-q0a">
   <li>
    Bad ozone forms near the ground when sunlight reacts with pollutants in the air. Ground-level ozone is harmful to the respiratory systems of humans and other animals.
   </li>
   <li>
    Good ozone forms in a thin layer high up in the atmosphere, between 15 and 35 kilometers above Earth&#8217;s surface. This ozone layer shields Earth from most of the sun&#8217;s harmful UV radiation. It plays an important role in preventing mutations in the DNA of organisms.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZTgxMGQ1NGM1NDIyODU0ZmM5Njk5OWJiNDU4YjNiY2M.-tdu">
   Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an
   <strong>
    ozone hole
   </strong>
   over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It&#8217;s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk.

  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZGZlZGY1OGEwMWRlY2Y1YjBhNWUxMjZjM2NhODIwZmQ.-giu">
   The world's climate is changing and California is now being affected in both dramatic and subtle ways. In 2008, scientists determined that California&#8217;s temperatures increased by more than 2.1&#176;F during the last century. What&#8217;s more, the data showed that human activity has played a significant role in that climate change. "What's just 2 degrees?" you may wonder. But, as the science shows, just 2 degrees is extremely significant.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-M2RkOTBjZjU3YzA5ZjY1NzRjNjliYWRmYTc5YzcyOTE.-z3a">
   What does all this temperature change mean? For starters, declining mountain snowpack and prolonged drought conditions could pose a threat to limited water supplies. Heat waves are projected to be longer, bringing increased danger from wildfires and heat-related deaths. Rising sea levels due to temperature shifts jeopardize life in coastal areas, both for human communities and the plants and animals that rely on intertidal and rich wetland ecosystems. Also, more precipitation is expected to fall as rain rather than snow, thereby increasing the risk of floods. And, as heat increases the formation of smog, poor air quality could get even worse.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-YzNkZjNiMmY1MTkzZTI5ZTI1NjU5OTMwOTM3ZDY4NzM.-pzr">
   Climate change may also profoundly affect the economy in California and elsewhere. Shorter ski seasons and damage to the marine ecosystem mean a reduction in tourism. Water shortages mean issues with the commercial and recreational fishing industry, and higher temperatures will affect crop growth and quality, weakening the agricultural industry, to name just a few of the economic issues associated with climate change.

   Melting glaciers, rising temperatures and droughts are all impacts of global warming. But how does global warming actually affect the oceans? The sea, it turns out, absorbs carbon dioxide emissions. The ocean acts like a giant sponge, absorbing carbon dioxide emissions from the air. And as we add more and more carbon dioxide to air by burning fossil fuels, the ocean is absorbing it. On one level, it's done us a big favor. Scientists say that we would be experiencing much more extreme climate change were it not for the ocean's ability to remove the heat-trapping gas. However, these emissions are causing the oceans to become more acidic. Changing pH levels threaten entire marine food webs, from coral reefs to salmon. See

We also need to switch to energy sources that produce less carbon dioxide, such as solar and wind energy. At the same time, we can increase the amount of carbon dioxide that is removed from air. We can stop destroying forests and plant new ones.

   Each year, April 22 marks the anniversary of what many consider the birth of the modern environmental movement in 1970. The idea came to Earth Day founder Gaylord Nelson, then a U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, after witnessing the ravages of the 1969 massive oil spill in Santa Barbara, California. On the 22nd of April, 20 million Americans took to the streets, parks, and auditoriums to demonstrate for a healthy, sustainable environment in massive coast-to-coast rallies. Thousands of colleges and universities organized protests against the deterioration of the environment. Groups that had been fighting against oil spills, polluting factories and power plants, raw sewage, toxic dumps, pesticides, freeways, the loss of wilderness, and the extinction of wildlife suddenly realized they shared common values.

   As 1990 approached, a group of environmental leaders organized another big campaign. This time, Earth Day went global, mobilizing 200 million people in 141 countries and lifting environmental issues onto the world stage. Earth Day 1990 gave a huge boost to recycling efforts worldwide and helped pave the way for the 1992 United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.

   <li>
    Renewable resources can be replaced by natural processes as quickly as humans use them. Examples include sunlight and wind. Nonrenewable resources exist in fixed amounts. They can be used up. Examples include fossil fuels such as coal.
   </li>
   <li>
    Soil and water are renewable resources but may be ruined by careless human actions. Soil can be depleted of nutrients. It can also be eroded by wind or water. Over-use and pollution of freshwater threaten the limited supply that people depend on.
   </li>
   <li>
    Air pollution consists of chemical substances and particles released into the air, mainly by human actions. The major cause of outdoor air pollution is the burning of fossil fuels. Indoor air can also be polluted. Air pollution, in turn, causes acid rain, ozone depletion, and global warming.
   </li>
   <li>
    Gases such as carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels increase the natural greenhouse effect. This is raising the temperature of Earth&#8217;s surface, and is called global warming.
