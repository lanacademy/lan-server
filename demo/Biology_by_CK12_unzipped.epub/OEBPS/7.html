   Your DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, contains the genes that determine who you are. How can this organic molecule control your characteristics? DNA contains instructions for all the proteins your body makes. Proteins, in turn, determine the structure and function of all your cells. What determines a protein&#8217;s structure? It begins with the sequence of amino acids that make up the protein. Instructions for making proteins with the correct sequence of amino acids are encoded in DNA.

   DNA is found in chromosomes. In eukaryotic cells, chromosomes always remain in the nucleus, but proteins are made at ribosomes in the cytoplasm. How do the instructions in DNA get to the site of protein synthesis outside the nucleus? Another type of nucleic acid is responsible. This nucleic acid is RNA, or ribonucleic acid. RNA is a small molecule that can squeeze through pores in the nuclear membrane. It carries the information from DNA in the nucleus to a ribosome in the cytoplasm and then helps assemble the protein. In short:

   Griffith Searches for the Genetic Material
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-OTU1NmU2NDhhNTkwMzdiMDA2ZTY0NGIwYjNhMTQ4ZWM.-zfh">
   Many scientists contributed to the identification of DNA as the genetic material. In the 1920s, Frederick Griffith made an important discovery. He was studying two different strains of a bacterium, called R (rough) strain and S (smooth) strain. He injected the two strains into mice. The S strain killed (virulent) the mice, but the R strain did not (nonvirulent) (see
   <strong>

   ). Griffith also injected mice with S-strain bacteria that had been killed by heat. As expected, the killed bacteria did not harm the mice. However, when the dead S-strain bacteria were mixed with live R-strain bacteria and injected, the mice died.

   Avery&#8217;s Team Makes a Major Contribution
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MmJhYzM0MTYzMTY3NzVlM2MxODQwZTNhOWE3NGM5MTc.-ohz">
   In the early 1940s, a team of scientists led by Oswald Avery tried to answer the question raised by Griffith&#8217;s results. They inactivated various substances in the S-strain bacteria. They then killed the S-strain bacteria and mixed the remains with live R-strain bacteria. (Keep in mind, the R-strain bacteria usually did not harm the mice.) When they inactivated proteins, the R-strain was deadly to the injected mice. This ruled out proteins as the genetic material. Why? Even without the S-strain proteins, the R-strain was changed, or transformed, into the deadly strain. However, when the researchers inactivated DNA in the S-strain, the R-strain remained harmless. This led to the conclusion that DNA is the substance that controls the characteristics of organisms. In other words, DNA is the genetic material.

   Hershey and Chase Seal the Deal
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-YjE1NDU4NzRkNmYwMzU0M2U3NDVhYmQ2NTgzZmNjNGI.-vhj">
   The conclusion that DNA is the genetic material was not widely accepted at first. It had to be confirmed by other research. In the 1950s, Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase did experiments with viruses and bacteria. Viruses are not cells. They are basically DNA inside a protein coat. To reproduce, a virus must insert its own genetic material into a cell (such as a bacterium). Then it uses the cell&#8217;s machinery to make more viruses. The researchers used different radioactive elements to label the DNA and proteins in viruses. This allowed them to identify which molecule the viruses inserted into bacteria. DNA was the molecule they identified. This confirmed that DNA is the genetic material.

   Chargaff Writes the Rules
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZTc5MTM0ZTNjZTJmMDY2M2U4ZjcyZjE0ZjlmODA3ZDA.-bgc">
   Other important discoveries about DNA were made in the mid-1900s by Erwin Chargaff. He studied DNA from many different species. He was especially interested in the four different nitrogen bases of DNA: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T) (see
   <strong>

   <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTA3LTAyLW5pdHJvZ2VuLUJhc2VzLWluLUROQQ..">

   </a>
   ). Chargaff found that concentrations of the four bases differed from one species to another. However, within each species, the concentration of adenine was always about the same as the concentration of thymine. The same was true of the concentrations of guanine and cytosine. These observations came to be known as
   <strong>
    Chargaff&#8217;s rules
   </strong>
   . The significance of the rules would not be revealed until the structure of DNA was discovered.

   The Double Helix

   The double helix shape of DNA, together with Chargaff&#8217;s rules, led to a better understanding of DNA. DNA, as a nucleic acid, is made from nucleotide monomers, and the DNA double helix consists of two polynucleotide chains. Each nucleotide consists of a sugar (deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and a nitrogen-containing base (A, C, G, or T). The sugar-phosphate backbone of the double helix was discussed in the
   <em>
    Chemistry of Life
   </em>
   chapter.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-NGRjNGZkOTFlZjM3YWE1ZWUyMjczNWZjMjkyYTcyYzY.-aro">
   Scientists concluded that bonds (hydrogen bonds) between complementary bases hold together the two polynucleotide chains of DNA. Adenine always bonds with its complementary base, thymine. Cytosine always bonds with its complementary base, guanine. If you look at the nitrogen bases in

   , you will see why. Adenine and guanine have a two-ring structure. Cytosine and thymine have just one ring. If adenine were to bind with guanine and cytosine with thymine, the distance between the two DNA chains would be variable. However, when a one-ring molecule binds with a two-ring molecule, the distance between the two chains is kept constant. This maintains the uniform shape of the DNA double helix. These
   <em>
    base pairs
   </em>
   (A-T or G-C) stick into the middle of the double helix, forming, in essence, the steps of the spiral staircase.

   DNA Replication

  <p id="x-ck12-MDY0YTI3ZWJhZWZkOTdkMmVmNWI1MWU4NzJiZmM2ODY.-lqv">
   Knowledge of DNA&#8217;s structure helped scientists understand how DNA replicates. DNA replication is the process in which DNA is copied. It occurs during the synthesis (S) phase of the eukaryotic cell cycle. DNA replication begins when an enzyme breaks the bonds between complementary bases in DNA (see
   <strong>

   </strong>
   <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTA3LTA0LUROQS1yZXBsaWNhdGlvbg..">

   ). This exposes the bases inside the molecule so they can be &#8220;read&#8221; by another enzyme and used to build two new DNA strands with complementary bases. The two daughter molecules that result each contain one strand from the parent molecule and one new strand that is complementary to it. As a result, the two daughter molecules are both identical to the parent molecule. The process of DNA replication is actually much more complex than this simple summary. You can see a detailed animation of the process at this link:

RNA then leaves the nucleus and goes to a ribosome in the cytoplasm, where translation occurs. Translation reads the genetic code in mRNA and makes a protein.

    Initiation is the beginning of transcription. It occurs when the enzyme RNA polymerase binds to a region of a gene called the
    <strong>
     promoter
    </strong>
    . This signals the DNA to unwind so the enzyme can &#8220;read&#8221; the bases in one of the DNA strands. The enzyme is ready to make a strand of mRNA with a complementary sequence of bases.
   </li>
   <li>
    Elongation is the addition of nucleotides to the mRNA strand.
   </li>
   <li>
    Termination is the ending of transcription. The mRNA strand is complete, and it detaches from DNA.

   Processing mRNA
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NTM4Mjc0MjBkM2UzNmZkMzdlN2FiY2UxZTc3MzkyZjA.-tv8">
   In eukaryotes, the new mRNA is not yet ready for translation. It must go through more processing before it leaves the nucleus. This may include splicing, editing, and polyadenylation. These processes modify the mRNA in various ways. Such modifications allow a single gene to be used to make more than one protein.
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-YzdjNWYzOTY5MzczMjg5NzQ4YTFhN2ZmNTU2YTE2Y2U.-4jc">

   </li>
   <li>
    Editing changes some of the nucleotides in mRNA. For example, the human protein called APOB, which helps transport lipids in the blood, has two different forms because of editing. One form is smaller than the other because editing adds a premature stop signal in mRNA.
   </li>
   <li>
    Polyadenylation adds a &#8220;tail&#8221; to the mRNA. The tail consists of a string of As (adenine bases). It signals the end of mRNA. It is also involved in exporting mRNA from the nucleus. In addition, the tail protects mRNA from enzymes that might break it down.

   shows how this happens. After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it moves to a ribosome, which consists of rRNA and proteins. The ribosome reads the sequence of codons in mRNA. Molecules of tRNA bring amino acids to the ribosome in the correct sequence. To understand the role of tRNA, you need to know more about its structure. Each tRNA molecule has an anticodon for the amino acid it carries. An anticodon is complementary to the codon for an amino acid. For example, the amino acid lysine has the codon AAG, so the anticodon is UUC. Therefore, lysine would be carried by a tRNA molecule with the anticodon UUC. Wherever the codon AAG appears in mRNA, a UUC anticodon of tRNA temporarily binds. While bound to mRNA, tRNA gives up its amino acid. Bonds form between the amino acids as they are brought one by one to the ribosome, forming a polypeptide chain. The chain of amino acids keeps growing until a stop codon is reached. To see how this happens, go the link below.

   <li>
    The genetic code consists of the sequence of bases in DNA or RNA. Groups of three bases form codons, and each codon stands for one amino acid (or start or stop). The codons are read in sequence following the start codon until a stop codon is reached. The genetic code is universal, unambiguous, and redundant.

   <li>
    Translation is the
    <em>
     RNA &#8594; protein
    </em>
    part of the central dogma. It occurs at a ribosome. During translation, a protein is synthesized using the codons in mRNA as a guide. All three types of RNA play a role in translation.

   Introduction

   A change in the sequence of bases in DNA or RNA is called a
   <strong>
    mutation
   </strong>
   . Does the word mutation make you think of science fiction and bug-eyed monsters? Think again. Everyone has mutations. In fact, most people have dozens or even hundreds of mutations in their DNA. Mutations are essential for evolution to occur. They are the ultimate source of all new genetic material in a species. Although most mutations have no effect on the organisms in which they occur, some mutations are beneficial. Even harmful mutations rarely cause drastic changes in organisms.

   Causes of Mutation

  <p id="x-ck12-MDQ3NzdiMjM0N2IzZjZhMzk3Yzc0ZGJkOTA4ZjViMWM.-hey">
   Mutations have many possible causes. Some mutations seem to happen spontaneously without any outside influence. They occur when mistakes are made during DNA replication or transcription. Other mutations are caused by environmental factors. Anything in the environment that can cause a mutation is known as a

  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-Mjg0OTQzNGQ0ODMyNTRlOGM2Mjk3M2VlYjk1MGE0ZTU.-riy">
   There are a variety of types of mutations. Two major categories of mutations are germline mutations and somatic mutations.

   <li>
    <strong>
     Germline mutations
    </strong>
    occur in gametes. These mutations are especially significant because they can be transmitted to offspring and every cell in the offspring will have the mutation.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Somatic mutations
    </strong>
    occur in other cells of the body. These mutations may have little effect on the organism because they are confined to just one cell and its daughter cells. Somatic mutations cannot be passed on to offspring.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p id="x-ck12-YmU3MzBiNWJmNmMxMGNkMDQ4ZDEzODFmOTgwZjdjYmQ.-rp1">
   Mutations also differ in the way that the genetic material is changed. Mutations may change the structure of a chromosome or just change a single nucleotide.

   Frameshift Mutations
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NTQ3YWIyMTg5MzI3ZGNjOTdjNzdiMWRkYjljNjRiMTE.-ob7">
   A
   <strong>
    frameshift mutation
   </strong>
   is a deletion or insertion of one or more nucleotides that changes the reading frame of the base sequence. Deletions remove nucleotides, and insertions add nucleotides. Consider the following sequence of bases in RNA:
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-NmEwYjZmZTBjY2QyYWMzODM4NjMyZjgyMDI5ZmQxZjM.-7bo">
   <strong>
    AUG-AAU-ACG-GCU = start-asparagine-threonine-alanine
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-NGM4NTMzNjk3ZTc4ZThlMDljZWJiZjExOGZjN2IxMjE.-d3o">
   Now, assume an insertion occurs in this sequence. Let&#8217;s say an
   <strong>
    A
   </strong>
   nucleotide is inserted after the start codon
   <strong>
    AUG
   </strong>
   :
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-Y2M0ZTMwYjFkMTU4MDczOTVlMmRhMTU4MDU1ZmYxOTY.-5xg">
   <strong>
    AUG-AAA-UAC-GGC-U = start-lysine-tyrosine-glycine
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-MmZhOGFmZWUwZGYyNTRmZmE4ZTgyZWFkZjc2YjUyNWU.-0se">
   Even though the rest of the sequence is unchanged, this insertion changes the reading frame and thus all of the codons that follow it. As this example shows, a frameshift mutation can dramatically change how the codons in mRNA are read. This can have a drastic effect on the protein product.

   Effects of Mutations

  <p id="x-ck12-NjM0NzhlMzJjZDU2YTZmOTMxZWM0MTdlNDkyYzM3MTA.-uki">
   The majority of mutations have neither negative nor positive effects on the organism in which they occur. These mutations are called neutral mutations. Examples include silent point mutations. They are neutral because they do not change the amino acids in the proteins they encode. Many other mutations have no effect on the organism because they are repaired before protein synthesis occurs. Cells have multiple repair mechanisms to fix mutations in DNA. One way DNA can be repaired is illustrated in

   Some mutations have a positive effect on the organism in which they occur. They are called beneficial mutations. They lead to new versions of proteins that help organisms adapt to changes in their environment. Beneficial mutations are essential for evolution to occur. They increase an organism&#8217;s changes of surviving or reproducing, so they are likely to become more common over time. There are several well-known examples of beneficial mutations. Here are just two:

   Imagine making a random change in a complicated machine such as a car engine. The chance that the random change would improve the functioning of the car is very small. The change is far more likely to result in a car that does not run well or perhaps does not run at all. By the same token, any random change in a gene's DNA is likely to result in a protein that does not function normally or may not function at all. Such mutations are likely to be harmful. Harmful mutations may cause genetic disorders or cancer.

   Sometimes even drastic mutations do not affect the proteins produced by a particular type of cell. The reason? The genes affected by the mutations are not normally used to make proteins in that type of cell. In all cells, some genes are turned off - they are not transcribed - while other genes are turned on.

   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-YTEzMTIxNzQ2ZDI0MDQ2MjFiZjI0NTJmMGI5MDE0NzE.-zda">
   Each of your cells has at least 20,000 genes. In fact, all of your cells have the same genes. Do all of your cells make the same proteins? Obviously not. If they did, then all your cells would be alike. Instead, you have cells with different structures and functions. This is because different cells make different proteins. They do this by using, or expressing, different genes. Using a gene to make a protein is called
   <strong>
    gene expression
   </strong>
   .

   How Gene Expression is Regulated
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-Y2E4ZTRkMTY4ZjNjYTZiNjAxZDhhYmJhNjRhOTg4YzM.-hj3">
   Gene expression is regulated to ensure that the correct proteins are made when and where they are needed. Regulation may occur at any point in the expression of a gene, from the start of transcription to the processing of a protein after translation. The focus in this lesson is the regulation of transcription. As shown in

   </a>
   , transcription is controlled by
   <strong>
    regulatory proteins
   </strong>
   . The proteins bind to regions of DNA, called
   <strong>
    regulatory elements
   </strong>
   , which are located near promoters. After regulatory proteins bind to regulatory elements, they can interact with RNA polymerase, the enzyme that transcribes DNA to mRNA. Regulatory proteins are typically either activators or repressors.
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-N2I4NzhjYTQyNGJkNDEwMWYzOTUzMWFiYzdmZGQxMTY.-key">
   <li>
    Activators promote transcription by enhancing the interaction of RNA polymerase with the promoter.
   </li>
   <li>
    Repressors prevent transcription by impeding the progress of RNA polymerase along the DNA strand.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p id="x-ck12-OGJkMTllODE4NjNjZjI5YzcyMDM5NGM2YmJiMjVjNTc.-xpk">
   Other factors may also be involved in the regulation of transcription, but these are typically the key players.

   The Role of Operons
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-OWU0ZTI3MjllMTZjNGE0NDk0ZjIzNzk5MjJhMGRiYjA.-ynl">
   Regulation of transcription in prokaryotes typically involves operons. An
   <strong>
    operon
   </strong>
   is a region of DNA that consists of one or more genes that encode the proteins needed for a specific function. The operon also includes a promoter and an operator. The
   <strong>
    operator
   </strong>
   is a region of the operon where regulatory proteins bind. It is located near the promoter and helps regulate transcription of the operon genes.
  </p>
  <h3 id="x-ck12-VGhlIExhYyBPcGVyb24._3-npi">
   The Lac Operon
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MTMxZmNiODZiNDA0ZGUxYzMzY2YwNDEwNTJjYjhkZjA.-2io">
   A well-known example of operon regulation involves the lac operon in

   and the video at the link below). The lac operon consists of a promoter, an operator, and three genes that encode the enzymes needed to digest lactose, the sugar found in milk. The lac operon is regulated by lactose in the environment.

   <li>
    When lactose is absent, a repressor protein binds to the operator. The protein blocks the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter. As a result, the lac genes are not expressed.
   </li>
   <li>
    When lactose is present, the repressor protein does not bind to the operator. This allows RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter and begin transcription. As a result, the lac genes are expressed, and lactose is digested.

   In eukaryotic cells, the start of transcription is one of the most complicated parts of gene regulation. There may be many regulatory proteins and regulatory elements involved. Regulation may also involve enhancers. Enhancers are distant regions of DNA that can loop back to interact with a gene&#8217;s promoter.

   The TATA Box
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-YTExZDhhYmIzZDZhNjE5NGVlN2ZkZDk0ZWM4NjAwODI.-hf2">
   Different types of cells have unique patterns of regulatory elements that result in only the necessary genes being transcribed. That&#8217;s why a skin cell and nerve cell, for example, are so different from each other. However, some patterns of regulatory elements are common to all genes, regardless of the cells in which they occur. An example is the
   <strong>
    TATA box
   </strong>
   . This is a regulatory element that is part of the promoter of most eukaryotic genes. A number of regulatory proteins bind to the TATA box, forming a multi-protein complex. It is only when all of the appropriate proteins are bound to the TATA box that RNA polymerase recognizes the complex and binds to the promoter. Once RNA polymerase binds, transcription begins. To see a video showing the role of the TATA box in the initiation of transcription, go to this link:

   The regulation of gene expression is extremely important during the development of an organism. Regulatory proteins must turn on certain genes in particular cells at just the right time so the organism develops normal organs and organ systems.
   <strong>
    Homeobox genes
   </strong>
   are an example of genes that regulate development. They code for regulatory proteins that switch on whole series of major developmental genes. In insects, homeobox genes called hox genes ensure that body parts such as limbs develop in the correct place.

  <ul id="x-ck12-YjJkZjJjNTI4NTEzNDFjYjY0YWIyYWY1MzIwZjY5YTA.-1hp">
   <li>
    Gene transcription is controlled by regulatory proteins that bind to regulatory elements on DNA. The proteins usually either activate or repress transcription.
   </li>
   <li>
    Regulation of transcription in prokaryotes typically involves an operon, such as the lac operon in
    <em>
     E. coli
    </em>
    . The lac operon is regulated by proteins that behave differently depending on whether lactose is present.
   </li>
   <li>
    Regulation of transcription in eukaryotes is generally more complex. It involves unique regulatory elements in different cells as well as common regulatory elements such as the TATA box. Regulation is especially important during development. It may involve regulatory genes such as homeobox genes that switch other regulatory genes on or off. Mutations in regulatory genes that normally control the cell cycle cause cancer.
