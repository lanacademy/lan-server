   The
   <strong>
    circulatory system
   </strong>
   can be compared to a system of interconnected, one-way roads that range from superhighways to back alleys. Like a network of roads, the job of the circulatory system is to allow the transport of materials from one place to another. As described in
   <strong>

   , the materials carried by the circulatory system include hormones, oxygen, cellular wastes, and nutrients from digested food. Transport of all these materials is necessary to maintain homeostasis of the body. The main components of the circulatory system are the heart, blood vessels, and blood. Each of these components is described in detail below.

   Unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle contracts without stimulation by the nervous system. Instead, specialized cardiac muscle cells send out electrical impulses that stimulate the contractions. As a result, the atria and ventricles normally contract with just the right timing to keep blood pumping efficiently through the heart.

    <strong>
     Arteries
    </strong>
    are muscular blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart. They have thick walls that can withstand the pressure of blood being pumped by the heart. Arteries generally carry oxygen-rich blood. The largest artery is the aorta, which receives blood directly from the heart.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Veins
    </strong>
    are blood vessels that carry blood toward the heart. This blood is no longer under much pressure, so many veins have valves that prevent backflow of blood. Veins generally carry deoxygenated blood. The largest vein is the inferior vena cava, which carries blood from the lower body to the heart.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Capillaries
    </strong>
    are the smallest type of blood vessels. They connect very small arteries and veins. The exchange of gases and other substances between cells and the blood takes place across the extremely thin walls of capillaries.

   Blood Vessels and Homeostasis
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-NWQ4OWM5OGU5MDI2ZGJlYjE4ZTQxODg2OTYwMWNjZGI.-5vn">
   Blood vessels help regulate body processes by either constricting (becoming narrower) or dilating (becoming wider). These actions occur in response to signals from the autonomic nervous system or the endocrine system. Constriction occurs when the muscular walls of blood vessels contract. This reduces the amount of blood that can flow through the vessels (see
   <strong>
    Figure
   </strong>
   <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTIzLTA0LVZhc29jb25zdHJpY3Rpb24tYW5kLWJsb29kLWZsb3c.">

   ). Dilation occurs when the walls relax. This increases blood flows through the vessels.

    When a blood vessel constricts, less blood can flow through it.
   </p>
  </div>
  <p id="x-ck12-Nzk2NTQ0MzU4ZTY5YjFkMDE1NmIwNTIyYjdmYjhiZDM.-l1x">
   Constriction and dilation allow the circulatory system to change the amount of blood flowing to different organs. For example, during a fight-or-flight response, dilation and constriction of blood vessels allow more blood to flow to skeletal muscles and less to flow to digestive organs. Dilation of blood vessels in the skin allows more blood to flow to the body surface so the body can lose heat. Constriction of these blood vessels has the opposite effect and helps conserve body heat.

   Many factors may increase the risk of developing coronary heart disease and other CVDs. The risk of CVDs increases with age and is greater in males than females at most ages. Having a close relative with CVD also increases the risk. These factors cannot be controlled, but other risk factors can, including smoking, lack of exercise, and high-fat diet. By making healthy lifestyle choices, you can reduce your risk of developing CVD.

    Blood
   </strong>
   is a fluid connective tissue. It circulates throughout the body through blood vessels by the pumping action of the heart. Blood in arteries carries oxygen and nutrients to all the body&#8217;s cells. Blood in veins carries carbon dioxide and other wastes away from the cells to be excreted. Blood also defends the body against infection, repairs body tissues, transports hormones, and controls the body&#8217;s pH.

  <p id="x-ck12-YTRkZTcwNzRhMzBmYTdhOTY5ZGRhMDM5YzUwYTczZWE.-dzs">
   Red blood cells are like trucks that transport cargo on a highway system. Their cargo is oxygen, and the highways are blood vessels. Where do red blood cells pick up their cargo of oxygen? The answer is the lungs. The lungs are organs of the respiratory system. The
   <strong>
    respiratory system
   </strong>
   is the body system that brings air containing oxygen into the body and releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

   Respiration
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-NjI4ODNhMDM2NjI4Zjk3YTBlYTYyMjAyNWEzZGZmMTk.-tiz">
   The job of the respiratory system is the exchange of gases between the body and the outside air. This process, called
   <strong>
    respiration
   </strong>
   , actually consists of two parts. In the first part, oxygen in the air is drawn into the body and carbon dioxide is released from the body through the respiratory tract. In the second part, the circulatory system delivers the oxygen to body cells and picks up carbon dioxide from the cells in return. The use of the word
   <em>
    respiration
   </em>
   in relation to gas exchange is different from its use in the term
   <em>
    cellular respiration
   </em>
   . Recall that cellular respiration is the metabolic process by which cells obtain energy by &#8220;burning&#8221; glucose. Cellular respiration uses oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. Respiration by the respiratory system supplies the oxygen and takes away the carbon dioxide.

   Respiration begins with
   <strong>
    ventilation
   </strong>
   . This is the process of moving air in and out of the lungs. The
   <strong>
    lungs
   </strong>
   are the organs in which gas exchange takes place between blood and air.
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-YjdlYjYxMDUyZmMyZGM5YTdhZWU3NmQyOTNjZDJiOTM.-vha">
   <li>
    Air enters the respiratory system through the nose. As the air passes through the nasal cavity, mucus and hairs trap any particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened so it won&#8217;t harm delicate tissues of the lungs.
   </li>
   <li>
    Next, the air passes through the
    <strong>
     pharynx
    </strong>
    , a long tube that is shared with the digestive system. A flap of connective tissue called the epiglottis closes when food is swallowed to prevent choking.
   </li>
   <li>
    From the pharynx, air next passes through the
    <strong>
     larynx
    </strong>
    , or voice box. The larynx contains vocal cords, which allow us to produce vocal sounds
   </li>
   <li>
    After the larynx, air moves into the
    <strong>
     trachea
    </strong>
    , or wind pipe. This is a long tube that leads down to the chest.
   </li>
   <li>
    In the chest, the trachea divides as it enters the lungs to form the right and left bronchi. The bronchi contain cartilage, which prevents them from collapsing. Mucus in the bronchi traps any remaining particles in air. Tiny hairs called cilia line the bronchi and sweep the particles and mucus toward the throat so they can be expelled from the body.
   </li>
   <li>
    Finally, air passes from the bronchi into smaller passages called bronchioles. The bronchioles end in tiny air sacs called alveoli.

   Pulmonary gas exchange is the exchange of gases between inhaled air and the blood. It occurs in the alveoli of the lungs. Alveoli (singular, alveolus) are grape-like clusters surrounded by networks of thin-walled pulmonary capillaries. After you inhale, there is a greater concentration of oxygen in the alveoli than in the blood of the pulmonary capillaries, so oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the blood across the capillaries (see

   Gas Transport
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MWQyMTI3OTcyMGI0NTA0NTZlZGM1ODAxOTZhYjllOGU.-eaw">
   After the blood in the pulmonary capillaries becomes saturated with oxygen, it leaves the lungs and travels to the heart. The heart pumps the oxygen-rich blood into arteries, which carry it throughout the body. Eventually, the blood travels into capillaries that supply body tissues. These capillaries are called peripheral capillaries.

  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZmMzOGZlZTc3NWFhNTY4MDQ1NDAwYTI4NDhlNzY2Njk.-gkb">
   The cells of the body have a much lower concentration of oxygen than does the oxygenated blood in the peripheral capillaries. Therefore, oxygen diffuses from the peripheral capillaries into body cells. Carbon dioxide is produced by cells as a byproduct of cellular respiration, so it is more concentrated in the cells than in the blood of the peripheral capillaries. As a result, carbon dioxide diffuses in the opposite direction.

   The carbon dioxide from body cells travels in the blood from the peripheral capillaries to veins and then to the heart. The heart pumps the blood to the lungs, where the carbon dioxide diffuses into the alveoli. Then, the carbon dioxide passes out of the body through the other structures of the respiratory system, bringing the process of respiration full circle.

   Gas Exchange and Homeostasis
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-MjIwNTM2ZDU3MjQxYmIwMzhkZWY4Njc5ZTVjN2ZmNzM.-fyd">
   Gas exchange is needed to provide cells with the oxygen they need for cellular respiration. Cells cannot survive for long without oxygen. Gas exchange is also needed to carry away carbon dioxide waste. Some of the carbon dioxide in the blood dissolves to form carbonic acid, which keeps blood pH within a normal range.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-NDQ0ZTJkZGRkZmI4Zjg5ZjRlNjRiZWQ3NjBmNmQyN2Q.-ghs">
   Blood pH may become unbalanced if the rate of breathing is too fast or too slow. When breathing is too fast, blood contains too little carbon dioxide and becomes too basic. When breathing is too slow, blood contains too much carbon dioxide and becomes too acidic. Clearly, to maintain proper blood pH, the rate of breathing must be regulated.

   How Breathing Occurs
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-YmQ3OTUwZjllN2VjMTcxZTdiOTEyZGIwMmU1ZTM4OGY.-e0v">
   Inhaling is an active movement that results from the contraction of a muscle called the diaphragm. The diaphragm is large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs (see

   <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTIzLTExLXJlc3BpcmF0aW9u">

   ). When the diaphragm contracts, the ribcage expands and the contents of the abdomen move downward. This results in a larger chest volume, which decreases air pressure inside the lungs. With lower air pressure inside than outside the lungs, air rushes into the lungs. When the diaphragm relaxes, the opposite events occur. The volume of the chest cavity decreases, air pressure inside the lungs increases, and air flows out of the lungs, like air rushing out of a balloon.

  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-OTAzZDdhZWMzNDdjOTQ2ZDliOGEzMWU0NTgyNjQ3NmE.-9ap">
   The regular, rhythmic contractions of the diaphragm are controlled by the brain stem. It sends nerve impulses to the diaphragm through the autonomic nervous system. The brain stem monitors the level of carbon dioxide in the blood. If the level becomes too high, it &#8220;tells&#8221; the diaphragm to contract more often. Breathing speeds up, and the excess carbon dioxide is released into the air. The opposite events occur when the level of carbon dioxide in the blood becomes too low. In this way, breathing keeps blood pH within a narrow range.

   Lesson Summary
  </h2>
  <ul id="x-ck12-ZmJiOGI3YzY4NTM0ZWE2MzJhZmJkZjRiYTdkYThmYTE.-x3n">
   <li>
    Respiration is the process in which gases are exchanged between the body and the outside air. The lungs and other organs of the respiratory system bring oxygen into the body and release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
   </li>
   <li>
    Respiration begins with ventilation, the process of moving air into and out of the lungs. Gas exchange in the lungs takes place in across the thin walls of pulmonary arteries in tiny air sacs called alveoli. Oxygenated blood is transported by the circulatory system from lungs to tissues throughout the body. Gas exchange between blood and body cells occurs across the walls of peripheral capillaries.
   </li>
   <li>
    Gas exchange helps maintain homeostasis by supplying cells with oxygen, carrying away carbon dioxide waste, and maintaining proper pH of the blood.
   </li>
   <li>
    Breathing occurs due to repeated contractions of a large muscle called the diaphragm. The rate of breathing is regulated by the brain stem. It monitors the level of carbon dioxide in the blood and triggers faster or slower breathing as needed to keep the level within a narrow range.
   </li>
   <li>
    Diseases of the respiratory system include asthma, pneumonia, and emphysema.

   The organs of the GI tract are lined with mucous membranes that secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients. The organs are also covered by layers of muscle that enable peristalsis.
   <strong>
    Peristalsis
   </strong>
   is an involuntary muscle contraction that moves rapidly along an organ like a wave (see

   Functions of the Digestive System
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZTE3NWQ0NmVlMTNjODY3ZmExMDU5ZjNmNmI2NWZmMDE.-lpd">
   The digestive system has three main functions: digestion of food, absorption of nutrients, and elimination of solid food waste.
   <strong>
    Digestion
   </strong>
   is the process of breaking down food into components the body can absorb. It consists of two types of processes: mechanical digestion and chemical digestion.
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-OGU5ZjhhYzQxNmNkOWFiZDM2NmQ0OGI4NjY3ZWU2N2U.-hf1">
   <li>
    <strong>
     Mechanical digestion
    </strong>
    is the physical breakdown of chunks of food into smaller pieces. This type of digestion takes place mainly in the mouth and stomach.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Chemical digestion
    </strong>
    is the chemical breakdown of large, complex food molecules into smaller, simpler nutrient molecules that can be absorbed by the blood. This type of digestion begins in the mouth and stomach but occurs mainly in the small intestine.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p id="x-ck12-Yzg5NDVhMWM3NzZmNjk2ZjlkODBhZGFjZjZjZDA4Mjk.-aqr">
   After food is digested, the resulting nutrients are absorbed.
   <strong>
    Absorption
   </strong>
   is the process in which substances pass into the bloodstream, where they can circulate throughout the body. Absorption of nutrients occurs mainly in the small intestine. Any remaining matter from food that cannot be digested and absorbed passes into the large intestine as waste. The waste later passes out of the body through the anus in the process of
   <strong>
    elimination
   </strong>
   .

   Mouth
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-MWYzM2Q1ZTU2Y2VmNzVhYjA0N2Q3MDQyYjRhNTM4NmE.-os2">
   The mouth is the first digestive organ that food enters. The sight, smell, or taste of food stimulates the release of digestive enzymes by salivary glands inside the mouth. The major salivary enzyme is amylase. It begins the chemical digestion of carbohydrates by breaking down starch into sugar.
  </p>

   The mouth also begins the process of mechanical digestion. Sharp teeth in the front of the mouth cut or tear food when you bite into it (see
   <strong>
    Figure
   </strong>
   <a href="#x-ck12-QmlvLTIzLTE1LVRlZXRo">

   </a>
   ). Broad teeth in the back of the mouth grind food when you chew. Food is easier to chew because it is moistened by saliva from the salivary glands. The tongue helps mix the food with saliva and also helps you swallow. After you swallow, the chewed food passes into the pharynx.

   From the pharynx, the food moves into the esophagus. The

   is a long, narrow tube that passes food from the pharynx to the stomach by peristalsis. The esophagus has no other digestive functions. At the end of the esophagus, a muscle called a sphincter controls the entrance to the stomach. The sphincter opens to let food into the stomach and then closes again to prevent food from passing back into the esophagus.

   The
   <strong>
    stomach
   </strong>
   is a sac-like organ in which food is further digested both mechanically and chemically. (To see an animation of how the stomach digests food, go to the link below.) Churning movements of the stomach&#8217;s thick, muscular walls complete the mechanical breakdown of food. The churning movements also mix food with digestive fluids secreted by the stomach. One of these fluids is hydrochloric acid. It kills bacteria in food and gives the stomach the low pH needed by digestive enzymes that work in the stomach. The main enzyme is pepsin, which chemically digests protein. See

   The
   <strong>
    small intestine
   </strong>
   is a narrow tube about 7 meters (23 feet) long in adults. It is the site of most chemical digestion and virtually all absorption. The small intestine consists of three parts: the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum (see

   The
   <strong>
    liver
   </strong>
   is an organ of both digestion and excretion. It produces a fluid called
   <strong>
    bile
   </strong>
   , which is secreted into the duodenum. Some bile also goes to the
   <strong>
    gall bladder
   </strong>
   , a sac-like organ that stores and concentrates bile and then secretes it into the small intestine. In the duodenum, bile breaks up large globules of lipids into smaller globules that are easier for enzymes to break down. Bile also reduces the acidity of food entering from the highly acidic stomach. This is important because digestive enzymes that work in the duodenum need a neutral environment. The pancreas contributes to the neutral environment by secreting bicarbonate, a basic substance that neutralizes acid.

  <p id="x-ck12-ZTdmMWQ2M2RmNjU3NjM4MmIxNDI4NWJjMzdjYTYwYTY.-vao">
   Hepatitis C is a virus that causes cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. It&#8217;s the leading cause for liver transplants in the U.S., and an estimated 4 million Americans have the disease. Current treatments are difficult to tolerate and are often ineffective, but recent breakthroughs from scientists may soon produce a cure for the disease that claims more than 10,000 American lives each year.

   Food and Nutrients
  </h2>

   Did you ever hear the saying, &#8220;You are what you eat&#8221;? It&#8217;s not just a saying. It&#8217;s actually true. What you eat plays an important role in your health. Eating a variety of the right types of foods promotes good health and provides energy for growth and activity. This is because healthful foods are rich in nutrients.
   <strong>
    Nutrients
   </strong>
   are substances the body needs for energy, building materials, and control of body processes. There are six main classes of nutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, water, vitamins, and minerals. These six classes are categorized as macronutrients or micronutrients depending on how much of them the body needs.

   . They include carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and water. All macronutrients except water can be used by the body for energy. (The energy in food is measured in a unit called a Calorie.) The exact amount of each macronutrient that an individual needs depends on many factors, including gender and age. Recommended daily intakes by teens of three macronutrients are shown in

   </li>
   <li>
    Dietary proteins are broken down during digestion to provide the amino acids needed for protein synthesis. Any extra proteins in the diet not needed for this purpose are used for energy or stored as fat. One gram of proteins provides 4 Calories of energy.

    Minerals
   </strong>
   are chemical elements that are essential for body processes. They include calcium, which helps form strong bones and teeth, and potassium, which is needed for normal nerve and muscle function. Good sources of minerals include green leafy vegetables, whole grains, milk, and meats. Vitamins and minerals do not provide energy, but they are still essential for good health. The needed amounts generally can be met with balanced eating. However, people who do not eat enough of the right foods may need vitamin or mineral supplements.

The white tip of MyPyramid represents foods that should be eaten only once in awhile, such as ice cream and potato chips. They contain few nutrients and may contribute excess Calories to the diet. The figure &#8220;walking&#8221; up the side of MyPyramid represents the role of physical activity in balanced eating. Regular exercise helps you burn any extra energy that you consume in foods and provides many other health benefits. You should be active for about an hour a day most days of the week. The more active you are, the more energy you will use.

   Any unused energy in food&#8212;whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids&#8212;is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese.
   <strong>

   or greater.
   <strong>
    Body mass index (BMI)

    The digestive system consists of organs that break down food, absorb nutrients, and eliminate waste. The breakdown of food occurs in the process of digestion.
   </li>
   <li>
    Digestion consists of mechanical and chemical digestion. Mechanical digestion occurs in the mouth and stomach. Chemical digestion occurs mainly in the small intestine. The pancreas and liver secrete fluids that aid in digestion.
   </li>
   <li>
    Virtually all absorption of nutrients takes place in the small intestine, which has a very large inner surface area because it is covered with millions of microscopic villi.
   </li>
   <li>
    The absorption of water from digestive wastes and the elimination of the remaining solid wastes occur in the large intestine. The large intestine also contains helpful bacteria.
   </li>
   <li>
    Digestive system diseases include food allergies, ulcers, and heartburn.
   </li>
   <li>
    Nutrients are substances that the body needs for energy, building materials, and control of body processes. Carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and water are nutrients needed in relatively large amounts. Vitamins and minerals are nutrients needed in much smaller amounts.

   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-NGU2OTI1NmZkM2Y1NjY0MDU2OGUxMWQyNzg5YzJmMDk.-dxe">
   If you exercise on a hot day, you are likely to lose a lot of water in sweat. Then, for the next several hours, you may notice that you do not pass urine as often as normal and that your urine is darker than usual. Do you know why this happens? Your body is low on water and trying to reduce the amount of water lost in urine. The amount of water lost in urine is controlled by the kidneys, the main organs of the excretory system.

  <p id="x-ck12-MmY4YjY4YTEwMTJhMDE0YmEyMzBlMzdhZmVjYjE5MDA.-cae">
   <strong>
    Excretion
   </strong>
   is the process of removing wastes and excess water from the body. It is one of the major ways the body maintains homeostasis. Although the kidneys are the main organs of excretion, several other organs also excrete wastes. They include the large intestine, liver, skin, and lungs. All of these organs of excretion, along with the kidneys, make up the
   <strong>
    excretory system
   </strong>
   . This lesson focuses on the role of the kidneys in excretion. The roles of the other excretory organs are summarized below:
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-NGFhMmYwYTVhNjNmOWEwMDYxY2E5OTNjYzg2Y2RmYzE.-ur2">
   <li>
    The large intestine eliminates solid wastes that remain after the digestion of food.
   </li>
   <li>
    The liver breaks down excess amino acids and toxins in the blood.
   </li>
   <li>
    The skin eliminates excess water and salts in sweat.
   </li>
   <li>
    The lungs exhale water vapor and carbon dioxide.

    Blood enters the kidney through the renal artery, which branches into capillaries. When blood passes through capillaries of the glomerulus of a nephron, blood pressure forces some of the water and dissolved substances in the blood to cross the capillary walls into Bowman&#8217;s capsule.
   </li>
   <li>
    The filtered substances pass to the renal tubule of the nephron. In the renal tubule, some of the filtered substances are reabsorbed and returned to the bloodstream. Other substances are secreted into the fluid.
   </li>
   <li>
    The fluid passes to a collecting duct, which reabsorbs some of the water and returns it to the bloodstream. The fluid that remains in the collecting duct is urine.

   Excretion of Urine
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-YzA2MmVlZDEwYjMzODQwZGUzYTU2ZjYzMDZiYzIxNWI.-xvm">
   From the collecting ducts of the kidneys, urine enters the
   <strong>
    ureters
   </strong>
   , two muscular tubes that move the urine by peristalsis to the bladder (see
   <strong>
    Figure

   ). The
   <strong>
    bladder
   </strong>
   is a hollow, sac-like organ that stores urine. When the bladder is about half full, it sends a nerve impulse to a sphincter to relax and let urine flow out of the bladder and into the urethra. The
   <strong>
    urethra
   </strong>
   is a muscular tube that carries urine out of the body. Urine leaves the body through another sphincter in the process of
   <strong>
    urination
   </strong>
   . This sphincter and the process of urination are normally under conscious control.

   Kidneys and Homeostasis
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-M2VmZjhiNzhjNzIzMDI5OWU3YTdlM2FkZDRlYjJmNzM.-evl">
   The kidneys play many vital roles in homeostasis. They filter all the blood in the body many times each day and produce a total of about 1.5 liters of urine. The kidneys control the amount of water, ions, and other substances in the blood by excreting more or less of them in urine. The kidneys also secrete hormones that help maintain homeostasis. Erythropoietin, for example, is a kidney hormone that stimulates bone marrow to produce red blood cells when more are needed. The kidneys themselves are also regulated by hormones. For example, antidiuretic hormone from the hypothalamus stimulates the kidneys to produce more concentrated urine when the body is low on water.

  <p id="x-ck12-ODA2OWYzOTc3ODdkOTE3ODNmMDcyMTk0ZmU0MTJlMGQ.-6e5">
   A person can live a normal, healthy life with just one kidney. However, at least one kidney must function properly to maintain life. Diseases that threaten the health and functioning of the kidneys include kidney stones, infections, and diabetes.
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-YzEyNTg1NjNiNDY2YzVjMDE3MTI3ZmYzZTY3ZjA2NTI.-t8y">
   <li>
    Kidney stones are mineral crystals that form in urine inside the kidney. They may be extremely painful. If they block a ureter, they must be removed so urine can leave the kidney and be excreted.
   </li>
   <li>
    Bacterial infections of the urinary tract, especially the bladder, are very common. Bladder infections can be treated with antibiotics prescribed by a doctor. If untreated, they may lead to kidney damage.
   </li>
   <li>
    Uncontrolled diabetes may damage capillaries of nephrons. As a result, the kidneys lose much of their ability to filter blood. This is called
    <strong>
     kidney failure
    </strong>
    . The only cure for kidney failure is a kidney transplant, but it can be treated with dialysis.
