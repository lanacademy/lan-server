    This lush green landscape is thickly carpeted with trees and myriad of other plants. Much of Earth&#8217;s land is dominated by plants. Yet compared to our active existence as animals, plants are&#8212;literally&#8212;rooted to the ground. Their sedentary lives may seem less interesting than the active lives of animals, but plants are very busy doing extremely important work. All plants are chemical factories. Each year, they transform huge amounts of carbon (from carbon dioxide) into food for themselves and virtually all other land organisms.

   Like animals, plants have organs that are specialized to carry out complex functions. An organ is a structure composed of more than one type of tissue. A tissue, in turn, is a group of cells of the same kind that do the same job. In this lesson, you will read about the tissues that do the important work of plants. The cells that make up plant tissues are described first.

   Plant Cell Structures
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-ZTQ2NzVlN2YzNjQyMzYyYTg2NDM2Yjk5MjIwYzUzNTI.-fvx">
   Structures found in plant cells but not animal cells include a large central vacuole, cell wall, and plastids such as chloroplasts.
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-MGRlMjVkNDdjNWRmNTM5YjM3ZDBjYjIzOTUxYWQwZmU.-ewd">
   <li>
    The large central vacuole is surrounded by its own membrane and contains water and dissolved substances. Its primary role is to maintain pressure against the inside of the cell wall, giving the cell shape and helping to support the plant.
   </li>
   <li>
    The cell wall is located outside the cell membrane. It consists mainly of cellulose and may also contain lignin, which makes it more rigid. The cell wall shapes, supports, and protects the cell. It prevents the cell from absorbing too much water and bursting. It also keeps large, damaging molecules out of the cell.
   </li>
   <li>
    Plastids are membrane-bound organelles with their own DNA. Examples are chloroplasts and chromoplasts. Chloroplasts contain the green pigment chlorophyll and carry out photosynthesis. Chromoplasts make and store other pigments. They give flower petals their bright colors.

   Growth of Plants
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-MGI3ZGQ3MzZkZGU2ZTYyMzY3MmJiNDM4ZGM3NmIxMzE.-3jm">
   Most plants continue to grow throughout their lives. Like other multicellular organisms, plants grow through a combination of cell growth and cell division. Cell growth increases cell size, while cell division (mitosis) increases the number of cells. As plant cells grow, they also become specialized into different cell types through cellular differentiation. Once cells differentiate, they can no longer divide. How do plants grow or replace damaged cells after that?

   The key to continued growth and repair of plant cells is
   <strong>
    meristem
   </strong>
   . Meristem is a type of plant tissue consisting of undifferentiated cells that can continue to divide and differentiate. Meristem at the tips of roots and stems allows them to grow in length. This is called primary growth. Meristem within and around vascular tissues allows growth in width. This is called secondary growth.

    Taproot systems feature a single, thick primary root, called the
    <strong>
     taproot
    </strong>
    , with smaller secondary roots growing out from the sides. The taproot may penetrate as many as 60 meters (almost 200 feet) below the ground surface. It can plumb very deep water sources and store a lot of food to help the plant survive drought and other environmental extremes. The taproot also anchors the plant very securely in the ground.
   </li>
   <li>
    Fibrous root systems have many small branching roots, called fibrous roots, but no large primary root. The huge number of threadlike roots increases the surface area for absorption of water and minerals, but
    <strong>
     fibrous roots

   <li>
    Absorbing water and minerals: Thin-walled epidermal cells and root hairs are well suited to absorb water and dissolved minerals from the soil. The roots of many plants also have a mycorrhizal relationship with fungi for greater absorption.
   </li>
   <li>
    Anchoring and supporting the plant: Root systems help anchor plants to the ground, allowing plants to grow tall without toppling over. A tough covering may replace the epidermis in older roots, making them ropelike and even stronger. As shown in

   Root Growth

  <p id="x-ck12-MGMzY2E0ZWZmMDA0ZTBlMGNlZmU5NWY1ZWM2MmIxOTI.-qnd">
   Roots have primary and secondary meristems for growth in length and width. As roots grow longer, they always grow down into the ground. Even if you turn a plant upside down, its roots will try to grow downward. How do roots &#8220;know&#8221; which way to grow? How can they tell down from up? Specialized cells in root caps are able to detect gravity. The cells direct meristem in the tips of roots to grow downward toward the center of Earth. This is generally adaptive for land plants. Can you explain why?

   Another vital function of stems is transporting water and minerals from roots to leaves and carrying food from leaves to the rest of the plant. Without this connection between roots and leaves, plants could not survive high above ground in the air. In many plants, stems also store food or water during cold or dry seasons.

     Bark

    is a combination of tissues that provides a tough, woody external covering on the stems of trees. The inner part of bark is alive and growing; the outer part is dead and provides strength, support, and protection.

    Ground tissue forms the interior of the stem. The large central vacuoles of ground tissue cells fill with water to support the plant. The cells may also store food.

    Bundles of vascular tissue run through the ground tissue of a stem and transport fluids. Plants may vary in how these bundles are arranged.

   The stems of all vascular plants get longer through primary growth. This occurs in primary meristem at the tips and nodes of the stems. Most stems also grow in thickness through secondary growth. This occurs in secondary meristem, which is located in and around the vascular tissues. Secondary growth forms secondary vascular tissues and bark. In many trees, the yearly growth of new vascular tissues results in an annual growth ring like the one in

    For photosynthesis, stomata must control the transpiration of water vapor and the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen. Stomata are flanked by guard cells that swell or shrink by taking in or losing water through osmosis. When they do, they open or close the stomata.

   ). The leaves of many plants turn from green to other, glorious colors during autumn each year. The change is triggered by shorter days and cooler temperatures. Leaves respond to these environmental stimuli by producing less chlorophyll. This allows other leaf pigments&#8212;such as oranges and yellows&#8212;to be seen.

However, to reduce water loss, they have needle-like leaves with very thick cuticle. On the downside, needle-like leaves reduce the surface area for collecting sunlight.

   Lesson Summary

  <ul id="x-ck12-YTBkZWZmYWMxY2VkMWUxZjJkNzVlNzhiMDkwZTc2ZDI.-wuo">
   <li>
    Roots absorb water and minerals and transport them to stems. They also anchor and support a plant, and store food. A root system consists of primary and secondary roots. Each root is made of dermal, ground, and vascular tissues. Roots grow in length and width from primary and secondary meristem.
   </li>
   <li>
    Stems hold plants upright, bear leaves and other structures, and transport fluids between roots and leaves. Like roots, stems contain dermal, ground, and vascular tissues. Trees have woody stems covered with bark.
   </li>
   <li>
    The primary function of leaves is to collect sunlight and make food by photosynthesis. Specialized tissues in leaves work together to perform this function. In a deciduous plant, leaves seasonally turn color and fall off the plant. They are replaced with new leaves later in the year. An evergreen plant keeps its green leaves year-round. It may have needle-like leaves to reduce water loss.

   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-MjdlYWM0N2Q1OGU5YjhhZDYyOWFhOGQyYThiNzZmMDQ.-mbs">
   The life cycle of all plants is complex because it is characterized by alternation of generations. Plants alternate between diploid sporophyte and haploid gametophyte generations, and between sexual and asexual reproduction. The ability to reproduce both sexually and asexually gives plants the flexibility to adapt to changing environments. Their complex life cycle allows for great variation.

   . From the figure, you can see that the diploid sporophyte has a structure called a
   <strong>
    sporangium
   </strong>
   (plural, sporangia) that undergoes meiosis to form haploid spores. A spore develops into a haploid gametophyte. The gametophyte has male or female reproductive organs that undergo mitosis to form haploid gametes (sperm or eggs). Fertilization of gametes produces a diploid zygote. The zygote grows and develops into a mature sporophyte, and the cycle repeats.

   Pollination occurs when pollen is transferred from a male to female cone. If sperm then travel from the pollen to an egg so fertilization can occur, a diploid zygote results. The zygote develops into an embryo within a seed, which forms from the ovule inside the female cone. If the seed germinates, it may grow into a mature sporophyte tree, which repeats the cycle.

Flowers produce spores that develop into gametophytes. Male gametophytes consist of just a few cells within a pollen grain and produce sperm. Female gametophytes produce eggs inside the ovaries of flowers. Flowers also attract animal pollinators.

   If pollination and fertilization occur, a diploid zygote forms within an ovule in the ovary. The zygote develops into an embryo inside a seed, which forms from the ovule and also contains food to nourish the embryo. The ovary surrounding the seed may develop into a fruit. Fruits attract animals that may disperse the seeds they contain. If a seed germinates, it may grow into a mature sporophyte plant and repeat the cycle.

   Lesson Summary
  </h2>
  <ul id="x-ck12-ZGU1OTdlYjNhMzY0ZDAwOWE3YmMwNjZhY2RiZTNlMzI.-zmd">
   <li>
    All plants have a life cycle with alternation of generations. Plants alternate between diploid sporophyte and haploid gametophyte generations, and between sexual reproduction with gametes and asexual reproduction with spores.
   </li>
   <li>
    In nonvascular plants, the gametophyte generation is dominant. The tiny sporophyte grows on the gametophyte plant.
   </li>
   <li>
    In vascular plants, the sporophyte generation is dominant. In seedless vascular plants such as ferns, the sporophyte releases spores from the undersides of leaves. The spores develop into tiny, separate gametophytes, from which the next generation of sporophyte plants grows.
   </li>
   <li>
    In seed plants, the gametophyte generation takes place in a cone or flower, which forms on the mature sporophyte plant. Each male gametophyte is just a few cells inside a grain of pollen. Each female gametophyte produces an egg inside an ovule. Pollination must occur for fertilization to take place. Zygotes develop into embryos inside seeds, from which the next sporophyte generation grows.

   Plants live just about everywhere on Earth. To live in so many different habitats, they have evolved adaptations that allow them to survive and reproduce under a diversity of conditions.

   Plant Adaptations

  <p id="x-ck12-ZDcyYmRhNTQyMjNlY2Q4YWRhNmVjMWQ3YjY4ZjAxNjA.-kwa">
   All plants are adapted to live on land. Or are they? All living plants today have terrestrial ancestors, but some plants now live in the water. They have had to evolve new adaptations for their watery habitat.

   Adaptations to Water
  </h3>
  <p id="x-ck12-M2JlZTQ3OGVlMGZiMTNkMTM5MWYwNzU0MDUzYWU4NDk.-kq6">
   Aquatic plants are plants that live in water. Living in water has certain advantages for plants. One advantage is, well, the water. There&#8217;s plenty of it and it&#8217;s all around. Therefore, most aquatic plants do not need adaptations for absorbing, transporting, and conserving water. They can save energy and matter by not growing extensive root systems, vascular tissues, or thick cuticles on leaves. Support is also less of a problem because of the buoyancy of water. As a result, adaptations such as strong woody stems and deep anchoring roots are not necessary for most aquatic plants.
  </p>
  <p id="x-ck12-MWFmYmFhMTkyMWUxYmE4NmYwOWFjNzhjNDE5OWI4OGI.-esh">
   Living in water does present challenges to plants, however. For one thing, pollination by wind or animals isn&#8217;t feasible under water, so aquatic plants may have adaptations that help them keep their flowers above water. For instance, water lilies have bowl-shaped flowers and broad, flat leaves that float. This allows the lilies to collect the maximum amount of sunlight, which does not penetrate very deeply below the surface. Plants that live in moving water, such as streams and rivers, may have different adaptations. For example, cattails have narrow, strap-like leaves that reduce their resistance to the moving water (see

   has adapted in all three ways. When it was still a very small plant, just a few inches high, its shallow roots already reached out as much as 2 meters (7 feet) from the base of the stem. By now, its root system is much more widespread. It allows the cactus to gather as much moisture as possible from rare rainfalls. The saguaro doesn&#8217;t have any leaves to lose water by transpiration. It also has a large, barrel-shaped stem that can store a lot of water. Thorns protect the stem from thirsty animals that might try to get at the water inside.

Being elevated above the ground lets epiphytes get out of the shadows on the forest floor so they can get enough sunlight for photosynthesis. Being elevated may also reduce the risk of being eaten by herbivores and increase the chance of pollination by wind.

   Like all organisms, plants detect and respond to stimuli in their environment. Unlike animals, plants can&#8217;t run, fly, or swim toward food or away from danger. They are usually rooted to the soil. Instead, a plant&#8217;s primary means of response is to change how it is growing. Plants also don&#8217;t have a nervous system to control their responses. Instead, their responses are generally controlled by hormones, which are chemical messenger molecules.

   Plants also detect and respond to the daily cycle of light and darkness. For example, some plants open their leaves during the day to collect sunlight and then close their leaves at night to prevent water loss. Environmental stimuli that indicate changing seasons trigger other responses. Many plants respond to the days growing shorter in the fall by going dormant. They suspend growth and development in order to survive the extreme cold and dryness of winter. Dormancy ensures that seeds will germinate and plants will grow only when conditions are favorable.

  <p id="x-ck12-YjliNzc1MTAwMDQ4MTA0OWEwNTdkNzRjZWUzMjg1MDg.-05k">
   Plants don&#8217;t have immune systems, but they do respond to disease. Typically, their first line of defense is the death of cells surrounding infected tissue. This prevents the infection from spreading. Many plants also produce hormones and toxins to fight pathogens. For example, willow trees produce salicylic acid to kill bacteria. The same compound is used in many acne products for the same reason. Exciting new research suggests that plants may even produce chemicals that warn other plants of threats to their health, allowing the plants to prepare for their own defense. As these and other responses show, plants may be rooted in place, but they are far from helpless.

   Lesson Summary
  </h2>
  <ul id="x-ck12-NzQzN2I3OWJlZjM4NzU3OTE0MjU3MzdmYmM5OGZlZDQ.-p7v">
   <li>
    Plants live just about everywhere on Earth, so they have evolved adaptations that allow them to survive and reproduce under a diversity of conditions. Various plants have evolved adaptations to live in the water, in very dry environments, or in the air as epiphytes.
   </li>
   <li>
    Like all organisms, plants detect and respond to stimuli in their environment. Their main response is to change how they grow. Their responses are controlled by hormones. Some plant responses are tropisms. Plants also respond to daily and seasonal cycles and to disease.
   </li>

   Points to Consider
  </h2>
  <p id="x-ck12-MWI5YmM0OWNmMGEwOTlkNThlYzU5M2E5MjQ4OWRmMmI.-qj1">
   In this chapter you read about the cells, tissues, and organs that make up plants. You also read about plant life cycles. Like plants, animals are complex organisms with tissues and organs. Animals also have life cycles.
  </p>
  <ul id="x-ck12-Mjk5MzU0OTJjOGIxNTVlZWE2YWJmYjE3NmE4ZWZlOTQ.-72l">
   <li>
    How do the cells of animals differ from those of plants? What tissues and organs might be found in animals?
   </li>
   <li>
    What is the general animal life cycle? How does it differ from the general life cycle of plants?
