TurnKey Core source code walkthrough
====================================

`TurnKey Core`_ is a good place to start, as it's source code is
minimal, and mainly inherits from `common`_.

Makefile
--------

::

    include $(FAB_PATH)/common/mk/turnkey.mk

As you can see, the `Makefile`_ includes `mk/turnkey.mk`_, which defines
variables and the `build process`_ for TurnKey appliances. It inturn
includes `fab/share/product.mk`_ which is the main Makefile.

The ``fab's product.mk`` is designed to be configurable and extendable.

plan
----

::

    #include <turnkey/base>

Core's plan doesn't include packages of its own, but rather includes the
packages defined in `turnkey/base`_. The path is relative to
FAB_PLAN_INCLUDE_PATH which is defined in the ``fab's product.mk``.

overlay
-------

The overlay is minimum, but lets not forget that `mk/turnkey.mk`_
defines ``COMMON_OVERLAYS`` which specifies common
`overlays/turnkey.d`_.

conf.d
------

Core doesn't have a ``conf.d``, but as we saw in the overlay,
``mk/turnkey.mk`` defines ``COMMON_CONF`` which specifies common
`conf/turnkey.d`_.

As described in the `build process`_, common overlays and confs are
applied before the product ``overlay`` and ``conf.d``.

changelog, readme and images
----------------------------

The `changelog`_ describes changes for each release, and the version
specified is used in the product release package.

The `readme`_ and `images`_ (logo and screenshots) are used to generate
the appliance page on the TurnKey Linux website.
