Development
===========

Before getting started with development, you should have already
followed the `Installation`_ and `Setup`_ guides, resulting in a
successful build of `TurnKey Core`_.

Now for the fun stuff:

* `Recommended Git Flow and configuration`_
* `Build process and terminology`_
* `Appliance source code walkthrough`_
* `Improving and maintaining an appliance`_
* `Developing a new appliance`_
