LAN-Server
==========

##Current Features

 * It's a pretty apache file server
 * Right now on a scale of 1-"not working", this is an 11.


##Planned Features

Scripts:

 * Installation scripts and packages for out-of-box Debian
 * DNS and DHCP server to set up "offline" network with academy.lan
 * If supported, serves up network over hardware wireless card
 * Php/cgi script frontend to manage server
 * Optional registration to send weekly compressed student logs/analytics back to LAN Academy Inc in return for completion certificates 
 * A "auto-fix" USB that backs up student data then just wipes everything and reinstalls
 

Apps: 

 * Plugin-expandable flat-file learning software (LAN-LMS)
 * Classroom/schedule managment (Schooltool)
 * Student collaberation tools (Etherpad Lite)
 * Offline Wikipedia (kiwix-serve)
 * Digital Library with in-browser epub/pdf readers (lan-library, a combination of pdf.js, epub.js, and calibre?)
 * Computer lab managment software (epoptes?)
 * Some kind of frontend to easily switch between them/visually tie them together ([mod_layout](http://www.musc.edu/webserver/mod_layout.html) seems like either a reasonable or terrible option)
